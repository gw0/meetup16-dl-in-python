We don’t expect anything, because
we’re used to nothing ever coming.

Ničesar ne pričakujemo, ker
smo vajeni, da nič ne pride.

When nothing comes, we’ll be here.

Ko nič ne pride, bomo tu.

I believe in the mechanistic nature
of the universe, which is to say, I
believe in everything that wants
to destroy me, and dismiss as
spiritual hogwash all the things
that could offer me peace.

Nepomembno je,
je rekel nekdo, ki ga poznam.
Tvoje pesmi so nepomembne.
Umetnost potrebuje druge stvari.
Umetnost ne potrebuje ničesar.
V tem bi ji bila rada podobna.

Verjamem v mehanistično
naravo vesolja, se pravi,
verjamem v to, kar me hoče
uničiti, in odmislim kot
spiritualen čvek vse stvari, ki bi
mi lahko ponudile mir.

Give me a future to fight against
Give me tenderness and you’ll give me form

Daj mi prihodnost, da se borim proti njej
Daj mi nežnost in dobil bom obliko

The trembling of the hand
Against the frail window of the metro

Drget roke
Proti krhkemu steklu vlaka

This gaping hole which makes me write
This gaping hole between us

Ta zev, ki me žene, da pišem
Ta zev med nama

their failures, they say with a certain calm:
I am aware that I have been abandoned. You are
outside my reach. There is no sense in
insistence. Nobody loves when it is
required.

s svojimi porazi z določeno mirnostjo rečejo:
Zavedam se, da sem bil zapuščen. Zunaj
mojega dosega si. Nobenega smisla ni v
prepričevanju. Nihče ne ljubi, kadar se od njega
zahteva.
Toda ti ljudje so se naučili stvari,
ki jih ne zmorem. Od njih me ločuje
nemoč, zakrinkana v občutek za čast,
ki vse, česar se dotakne, predela v teorijo.
In kadar zares postane neznosno, je vse, kar lahko,
da v pretirano rahločutni maniri čakam na
dež, ki bi uskladil vreme z mojim razpoloženjem.

AND I’M MAKING ART

In delam umetnost

But these people have learned things
I am not able to. We are separated
by a weakness, disguised as a sense of honor,
which converts everything, by touching, into theory.
And when it gets truly unbearable, I can only,
in an exaggerated squeamish manner, wait for
rain that would align the weather with my mood.

It is said that people quietly
endeavor to die, because everything organic
strives to become inorganic,
and all movement strives towards
no longer being movement.
Things fall apart because they wish
to be left alone.

Govori se, da si ljudje po tihem
prizadevamo za smrt, ker vse organsko
teži k temu, da bi spet postalo anorgansko
in vsako gibanje teži k temu,
da ne bi bilo več gibanje.
Stvari razpadejo, ker si želijo,
da bi se jih pustilo pri miru.

There is a certain grace in bailing yourself out
with art. Grace, in which you speak,
liberated from a single-point of view’s constraint,
that prevents speech and points out the ineptitude,
that you never really avoid,
unfit to survive the exposure
required by being human.

Določena milost je v tem, da se rešiš
v umetnost. Milost, v kateri govoriš
razrešen prisile enega samega pogleda,
ki onemogoča govor in opozarja na nesposobnost,
ki se ji nikdar zares ne izogneš,
nepripravljen preživeti izpostavljanje,
ki ga zahteva to, da si človek.

Sad people surrender,
as medieval towns surrender.
After drawn out sieges. Arduously.
Under their own terms.
They can’t handle the burden. Guilt and gloom
are justly shared
by everybody present.

Žalostni ljudje se predajajo,
kot se predaja srednjeveška mesta.
Po dolgih obleganjih. Stežka.
Samo pod lastnimi pogoji.
Ne zdržijo bremena. Krivda in žalost
se pravično razdelita
med vse, ki so zraven.

To decline doesn’t help,
To be heartless is useful,
even if psychoanalysts claim,
that to renounce desire is to die beforehand.
I find it hard to face mirrors. They force me to
confront and mercilessly hate my face.
This separates me from beautiful people,
who can afford malice and fury, without
losing anything; loved and insured in advance.

Da odklanjaš, ne pomaga,
če si brez srca, je koristno,
čeprav psihoanalitiki pravijo, da vnaprej umre,
kdor se odreče želji. Težko se srečujem
v ogledalih, ki me silijo v soočenje
in neusmiljeno sovraštvo do svojega obraza.
To me loči od lepih ljudi, ki si lahko privoščijo
objestnost in togoto, ne da bi s tem kaj
izgubili; zavarovani in ljubljeni vnaprej.

Grace and affection demand strain
and it’s true – for me, nothing is ever easy.
It is irrelevant,
said someone that I know.
Your poems are irrelevant.
Art needs other things.
Art doesn’t need anything.
I would like to match.

Milina in naklonjenost terjata napor
in res je, da zame ni nič nikdar zlahka.
Nepomembno je,
je rekel nekdo, ki ga poznam.
Tvoje pesmi so nepomembne.
Umetnost potrebuje druge stvari.
Umetnost ne potrebuje ničesar.
V tem bi ji bila rada podobna.

There are truthful people, who can manage clarity,
without constantly reminding themselves,
that no untrue thing has ever been beautiful.
They don’t avoid their sadness and when confronting

So resnicoljubni ljudje, ki zmorejo jasnost,
ne da bi se nenehno opominjali,
da še nobena neresnična reč ni bila lepa.
Ne izogibajo se svoji žalosti in v soočenjih

ENGELS

Engels

I can say with certainty,
that the only man who could love me without
forcing himself,
is Friedrich Engels.

Z gotovostjo lahko rečem,
Da je edini moški, ki bi me lahko ljubil, ne da bi se
silil s tem,
Friedrich Engels.

There is a silent treaty among subordinates;
that at all times of the day,
without obligation,
and without a shutterbug, who would cram that
moment into eternity,
they can place their heads into each other’s lap,
and summon comfort.

Med drugouvrščenimi obstaja tihi dogovor,
Da lahko drug drugemu ob vseh trenutkih dneva
Brez obveze
In brez fotografa, ki bi trenutek tlačil v večnost,
Položijo glavo v naročje
In zahtevajo toplino.

I go to the bathroom
to fix my hair and smudged mascara.
I bump into a flock escaped from history text-books.
They drift in a long line along the narrow hallway.
They jostle past each other,
as if there was revelation at the end, or at least some
blueberry pie.
I feel uncomfortable,
when Robespierre grabs my collar and pushes me up
against the wall,
so my feet dangle ten centimeters above the ground.
Angry lad.
So much blood spilled for freedom of speech, and
now we’re all silent.
Nobody feels a sense of calling.
We’re making out with other losers in corners.
Nobody wants to lay out a plan for a better tomorrow.
There is no überman
that would suddenly appear and save the day.
I feel sorry for Robespierre.
His essay against capital punishment was good.
I move along his face with the edge of my palm.
He is not beautiful and he was wrong many times.
Yet I am full of compassion, when he stands before
me so upset.

8

Na stranišče grem,
Da bi si popravila frizuro in razmazano maskaro.
Zaletim se v trop pobeglih iz zgodovinskih učbenikov.
V dolgi vrsti jih nese po ozkem hodniku.
Drenjajo se drug mimo drugega,
Kot bi jih na koncu čakalo razodetje ali vsaj
borovničeva pita.
Neprijetno mi je,
Ko me Robespierre prime za ovratnik in me dvigne ob
steni,
Da z nogami bingljam deset centimetrov nad tlemi.
Jezen fant.
Toliko krvi za svobodo govora, in zdaj smo vsi tiho.
Nihče se ne čuti poklicanega.
Po kotih se mečkamo z drugimi zgubami.
Nihče ne bi predlagal svojega načrta za boljši jutri.
Nobenega nadčloveka ni nikjer,
Ki bi se iznenada pojavil in rešil stvar.
Žal mi je za Robespierra.
Tisti njegov spis proti smrtni kazni je bil dober.
Z robom dlani grem ob njegovem obrazu.
Ni lep in velikokrat se je zmotil.
Vendar sem polna sočutja, ko tako razburjen stoji
pred mano.
Pred zakonom sva enaka,
A treba mu bo razložiti,
Da ima enakost, kot vse na svetu,

We are equal before law,
but he needs explaining,
that equality, as all on Earth,
has its limit, one that is thin and hardly visible.
He can’t take me with him.
I go back to Friedrich —
there is nothing great about him.
I seek refuge in his kind subordination,
as orthodox Jews seek refuge in the shadow of His
wings.

Nekje svojo mejo, ki je tenka in komaj vidna.
Ne more me vzeti s sabo.
Vračam k Friedrichu —
Nič velikega ni na njem.
Zatekam se k njegovi dobrotljivi drugorazrednosti,
Kot se pravoverni Judje zatekajo v senco Njegovih
peruti.

DECONSTRUCT ME

Dekonstruiraj me

I
(with my libertine relation to reality)
Am a kind of perfection.

Jaz
(s svojim svobodomiselnim odnosom do resničnosti)
Sem neka popolnost.

Golden dreams of the avant-garde,
Dismantled identity,
Victory of a useless complication,
A girl turned into a washing machine,
The cut up body,
Strewn across the desert —

Zlate sanje avantgardistov
Razstavljena identiteta,
Zmagoslavje nekoristne komplikacije,
Dekle, ki se je spremenilo v pralni stroj,
Razkosano telo,
Raztreseno po puščavi —

This is what we fought for,
This is the kingdom
That prevailed over fascism,
I am your victory.
Thanks.

Za to smo se borili,
To je kraljestvo,
Ki je obračunalo s fašizmom,
Jaz sem vaša zmaga.
Hvala.

I don’t need attention,
I don’t demand love,
We’re fair and square with the universe,
It owes me no favor.

Ne potrebujem pozornosti,
Ne zahtevam ljubezni,
Z vesoljem sva poravnala račune,
Nobenih uslug mi ne dolguje.

I am the made-up perfection,
I am the infinity of made-up perfections,
That demand infinite upkeep,
I am, what I am
I am, what I know
I am, what I’ve fought for,
I am, what I turn away from,

Sem izmišljena popolnost,
Sem neskončno izmišljenih popolnosti,
Ki zahtevajo neskončno vzdrževanje,
Sem, kar sem,
Sem, kar znam,
Sem, kar sem si izborila,
Sem, od česar se obračam,

I am, what I’m facing toward
I am, what has been ascribed to me,
I am, what slides past unnoticed.

Sem, proti čemur sem obrnjena,
Sem, kar mi pripisujete,
Sem, kar neopaženo zdrsne mimo.

Deconstruct me,
This is the only intimate plea that I can make,
Deconstruct me,
Take me out of literature,
And ready me for love.

Dekonstruiraj me,
To je edina intimna zahteva, ki jo lahko postavim,
Dekonstruiraj me,
Vzemi me iz literature
In me pripravi za ljubezen.

UNDERSTANDING DISTANCE

RAZUMETI RAZDALJO

Literature raises impossible demands:
Write a poem about Italy
Because it is beautiful and important
And it binds you with all that is
Sublime in art
Or write a poem about getting laid
Because they all must understand
How changed love will forever be
Once it passed through your hands.

Literatura postavlja nekaj nemogočih zahtev
Kot napisati pesem o Italiji,
Ker je lepa in pomembna
In te zveže z vsem,
Kar je v umetnosti vzvišenega
Ali napisati pesem o tem, kako se daješ dol,
Ker morajo vsi razumeti,
Kako spremenjena bo za vselej ljubezen,
Odkar je šla skozi tvoje roke.

You have to go very far
Or use very demanding tools
So that things like fronts of churches
Or landscapes’ reliefs
Gain meaning
Be merciless
Force beauty to become unbinding
It must allow being gazed upon from a distance
It must demand nothing for itself
Think like owners of large factories
Or as encyclopédistes
Or as a sovereign
You must practice evasion,
Until they are outlined:
Homesickness in Bologna,
Reverie in Naples,
Improper footwear in Florence
And tooth-ache in Rome
As well as the temperature of skin,
Expressions on faces and the vigilance of people,

Treba je iti zelo daleč
Ali uporabiti zelo zahtevna orodja,
Da stvari kot pročelja cerkva
Ali relief pokrajine
Pridobijo na pomenu,
Biti neusmiljen,
Prisiliti lepoto, da je nezavezjuoča,
Da se pusti opazovati z razdalje,
Da ničesar ne zahteva zase,
Misliti kot lastniki velikih tovarn,
Kot enciklopedisti,
Kot oblast,
Treba se je vaditi v odmikanju,
Dokler se ne izrišejo
Domotožje v Bologni,
Zamaknjenost v Neaplju,
Neprimerna obutev v Firencah
In zobobol v Rimu
Pa tudi temperatura kože,
Izrazi na obrazih in čuječnost ljudi,

10

Besides whom you wake up,
Classified, placed, controlled.

Ob katerih se zbujaš,
Razvrščeni, umeščeni, obvladani.

It serves you well,
Understanding distance.
In the tract of everyday,
Where certain layers of understanding,
Even if they are beautiful and important,
Fall away.
And you can no longer count on their support,
In the tract where we talk, kiss and do business,
In the tract of interest
Between human things,
Under the reign of struggle,
Death, familial strife,
And incompatible political decisions,
Amidst gentle inconsideration,
The organic world and the market economy,
It serves you well.

Saj pride prav,
Razumeti razdaljo.
V pasu vsakodnevnega,
Kjer določene plasti razumevanja,
Četudi lepe in pomembne,
Odpadejo
In ne moreš več računati na njihovo oporo,
V pasu, kjer se govori, poljublja in posluje,
V pasu interesov,
Med človeškimi stvarmi,
Pod vladavino prizadevanj,
Smrti, družinskih sporov
In neuskladljivih političnih odločitev,
Sredi nežne brezobzirnosti
Organskega sveta in tržnega gospodarstva,
Pride prav.

Writing about
(As someone,
Who is able to administer precise depth to every wound,
As someone barely involved)
The sun, dropping behind the scenes of Tuscany
Or rising above a naked shoulder
On your left
Is learning to command the world.
Fulfilling the impossible demands of literature
Is learning to survive.

Popisati
(Kot nekdo,
Ki lahko vsaki rani natančno odmeri, kako globoka
sme biti,
Kot nekdo, ki je komaj še vpleten)
Sonce, kako pade za kuliso Toskane
Ali kako se dvigne nad golo ramo
Na tvoji levi
Je učiti se obvladovati svet.
Izpolniti nemogoče zahteve literature je
Učiti se preživeti.

Gentleness

Nežnost

Conciliation
With the world made loose by doubt
Always comes with the same image:

Pomiritev
S svetom, razmajanim od negotovosti,
Se vedno približuje v enaki podobi:

Someone is taking care —
Not necessarily of me,
But surely of something
That all delicate things share;
(Certain accolades,
Slight shifts on certain faces,
Twilight, crossing the mountain)
Beauty,
Impossible to humiliate into a footnote —

Da nekdo pazi —
Ne nujno name,
Gotovo pa na nekaj,
Kar si delijo vse občutljive stvari;
(Nekatera priznanja,
Premiki na nekaterih obrazih,
Somrak, ki preči goro)
Lepo,
Ki ga je nemogoče ponižati v opombo —

That someone with his gentleness
Keeps watch over reality.

Da nekdo s svojo nežnostjo
Čuva resničnost.

Ko sem se poslavljal,
si se, ker drugim nisi hotel
pokazati, da se zaljubljaš,
sklonil pod mizo in
mi razvezal vezalko.

It’s something like
if you called me right now.
I imagine you inside me.
Not even climbing inside —
your skinny chest tangles with my skinny chest
and our hearts
over-self-slid
beat together.

Približno tako je,
kot če bi me ti zdaj poklical.
Predstavljam si te v meni.
Niti ne nujno, da splezaš vame —
tvoj koščeni torzo se zaplete v moj koščeni torzo
in najini srci
čezse polzeči
zabijeta skupaj.

Your messages etched into night.
A tree grows into stone.
A blade of grass rams into gravel.
A word into flesh.

Tvoja sporočila zažrta v noč.
Drevo raste v kamen.
Bilka se v prod zaganja.
Beseda v meso.

In few beats of sore lips hours fall.
Deep brown salty pillars instead of eyes.
Two clenched cocks.
Pulse.
For a beat the universe centers itself amid navels.
Intrudes, the power’s core
exudes.

V nekaj utripih razdraženih ustnic padejo ure.
Globoko rjava slana stebriča namesto oči.
Dva sklenjena tiča.
Utrip.
Za hip se med popka usredišči vesolje.
Se vrine, izgine sredina moči.

This is one of those guys,
who say
they want to be porn stars.
They push their heads into walls
and their asses up high
and they beg you
to fuck them.
Then they rasp with pleasure.
They whisper,
how it strangely pricks them,
when you push it all in.
Colored long hair,
with lonesome bristles sprinkled faces.
They turn away.
Into the ceiling, the sheet, the wall.
Over the edge of the bed
across to the window outstretched necks,
with bulging tendons on them.
They’re catching the moon in their wide open mouths.
It’s then, when they appear beautiful.
When they are beautiful.
When they are angels of perfect bodies.
All of them tense and happy and soft.
Their black hair
sparkle then
as drowsy crows
on dew-covered fields of Cmurek.

To je eden tistih tipov,
ki pravijo,
da bi bili porno zvezde.
Tiščijo glave v zidove,
riti pa v zrak
in te prosijo,
da jih pofukaš.
Potem hropejo od užitka.
Šepetajo ti,
da jih čudno zbode,
ko jim ga zarineš do konca.
Pobarvani dolgi lasje,
z osamelimi kocinami posuti obrazi.
Proč se obračajo.
V zid, v rjuho, v strop.
Čez rob postelje
k oknu iztegnjeni vratovi,
izbočene kite na njih.
Luno lovijo s široko odprtimi usti.
Takrat je, ko se zazdijo lepi.
Ko so lepi.
Ko so angeli popolnih teles.
Vsi napeti in mehki in srečni.
Njihovi črni lasje
se lesketajo takrat
kot omotične vrane
na rosnih cmureških poljih.

For three days I’ve worked
for three days I’ve sat
didn’t sleep and didn’t eat
so I could buy myself a horse
and raze the enemy lines
this is my poem
this is my life
the bathroom’s too far
I open the window
and piss on the street
from the bus you
stare at my wrinkled cock
we’re both lit up so nice
I love you.

Tri dni sem delal
tri dni sedel
nisem spal in nisem jedel
da sem kupil konja
in porazil sovražno četo
to je moja pesem
to je moj lajf
stranišče je predaleč
okno odprem
in ščijem na cesto
iz avtobusa
se zazreš v mojega nagubanega tiča
kako lepo sva oba osvetljena
rad te imam.

But dust goes its own way.

A prah gre svojo pot.

Pressed by centuries it forms stone,
or the wind takes it
and makes rain fall
on meadows of Apače.

Pod pritiskom tisočletij se sprijema v kamen,
ali ga veter razpiha in potem
v troposferi dela dež,
ki zaliva apaške ravnice.

Rain rattles on the roof-tops,
under which children sleep,
it feeds their dreams —

Po strehah šklopota ta dež,
strehah, pod katerimi spijo otroci,
njihove sanje napaja —

The village drunks used to tell them about the time,
when Mura was still allowed to overflow
and it spilled over their dried out valley,
so they, then themselves children, ran
over the silver-gleaming fields
of planted fish.

Vaški pijanci so jim govorili o času,
ko je Muri še bilo dovoljeno poplavljati
in se je razlila čez njihovo izžeto dolino,
da so, takrat še sami otroci, tekali
čez srebrno-svetlikajoča se polja
naplavljenih rib.

and if there’s paper below

how deep, I ask,

over gravel and toes
and toes into gravel
and darkness
and goes.

Leta bodo stekla.
Stal bom v kristalno čisti mrzli vodi
čez prod in čez prste
in prste v prod
in tema
in not.

»Sometimes I can’t move anymore.« R. Juarroz

THE TYRANT OF HAPPINESS
—

—

Roots out
cleanliness
to remain lying.

The verb
twice:
am not.

—

—

When once again,
nothing will happen

To proceed from oneself
has nothing to do with me.

—

—

I watched myself,
how you were less and less
how regardless of march falls,
on Juarroz keeping silent,
onto you does not exist.
I watched in the dark the phosphorescent
inscriptions, sources of light without solace.
At night, alone in a line, in departments,
saw partially, saw astonished, at rest,
shining equally in the interval of years:
la tierra se abrio, and:
Spain, white under snow.
Something made up persists,
something real falls bluntly against the floor.

To stay the longest and not say.
To long the longest, longing more,
to speak the longest,
to dream the longest one and the same,
to finish the longest, without
pouring down, over the grass, over
asphalt, over rivers, across all.
To tremble the longest in view of this,
to repeat no the longest

24

To measure this with time.
As procedure, as weather,
a shake of hands, a blow, as once upon.
And to measure glaringly, as much
as you can, to neglect
the facts, with the deck, with screaming,

I used to know all sorts:
Numbers on the sails of my rivals,
spell foreign words, I was haunted
by verses that poured from Tomaž onto
the paper and from the paper into me.
If I saw something, it was for the first time:
my eyes were melting and burnt out.
I used to know how many lines
at least ten of Slovene poets
needed for their first book.
After each I counted my own.
It was a time when the world opened up like
like a fruit and all my precise and diligent
waiting could come to an end.
It was enough to loosen the grip, I found
something from which to push off.
It looked like making gestures in the dark among
people without hitting anyone.
We used to say to each other: my infinite grace.
The air smelled bitter. Things which indistinctly
passed, accumulated themselves and turned up somewhere …
the rest was devoured by verses and the verses by the world. And I am left
with things, which:
I search, invent, don’t devour.
Without dissecting something dead with this, which persists,
some amount of you which hurts. If I move
I constantly bump against something,
which echoes, is impermeable, I don’t recognize,
separated, nothing with me, alive and I get closer to,
and which from close up and in life and since ever,
and each time refuses to be renamed.

—
A waste of paper.
—
What certainly comes, people are.
It would be right to relinquish something:
the manner of arrivals,
the salt, which is not rough,
the fact, how you think of him,
life in its part,
tongues, in which you don’t say fear,
the times of abundance.
It’s necessary to repeat something for long
and fall out.
To gather water into your palms, to see through membranes,
through oneself, the hedge, the quicksand, the provisions,
the sleet, through ages ago, that there, trimmed.
Of late instead of elsewhere say hi.
To be equally neither here nor there.
—
Not necessarily somewhere
—
Cylinders next to each other,
to lift things from the ground and stand still,
set them down by chance, discard
oneself, away, where you searched,
neither, so, that no one stays
further, in position, you’re too
close, to push in, to wipe out with
a new line, with more complexity,
more tomorrow, less, a lot less,
absences.
To be here, let this mean whatever.
—
Between the surfaces steel, buoyancy and
screw-threads, a place for air, numbness

26

for descent, separation for decrease. So much,
that it doesn’t break, to set yourself apart
from the body in this way, from speech, from the role,
from manners, from you. And to allow,
that it under pressure also breaks.
—
To say no in this way.
—
This is on the surface, where I feel,
and deaden.
Something beneath preserves a very calm
sea, which warmly evaporates and coils
Enters the empty, into the eye and between the axis.
Invalid, I pluck the remains, in
dispute the axis they sway, gently, if there’s
an instant so to say, it suffices to reach into it
with your hand, to reassure yourself, to not give up,
to yes take yourself, to throw yourself, to result,
to show the force on yourself, until somewhere, and
when it’s not there, until where, you’re not there.
With some weight we grab ourselves
and the weight knows it prevails.
—
In truth I’m not afraid of anything,
this is what I fear now and at all times.
—
A Slovene poet calls a young Slovene poet.
Fuck your mother tongue, world days, traits,
the use of history, of moments, exertions, doubles,
wanders, chamois, guilty, to bend knees, horses neigh, to
collapse on the floor, to swallow, to swallow all of this, it dawns, in
plural, to equal posture with a letter, at the time of day, at
the fact, that you live, perpetually, at once, inside out, at once
with error, with lips and cannons, circles, which are only

called circles, in the parquet observe carefully, before you
turn around, as if touching something, midday, after rain,
amid braking and rustling, amid signs of inertia, the trails
of memory, lethargy, roughly say recoil, silently wait in
the emptiness. You among all, you by him, you incomprehensibly,
you also, you without saying, you no one escapes, you know very well.
—
To pen down tripartitely.
Determine duties, preserve anger.
Never forgive: neither the leaves, nor the world, nor people,
don’t tremble, but don’t leave, but, but
read: I shiver, to read: as air, to read: the same.
To remain on the same spot even if they move:
something at most at rest, personally, also if it comes
to the floor, to plates, to levels, the roots of cities, the closest
darkness, repeated at most in dusk, the most trees,
mostly into eyes, even if you remember it each time afterwards.
To stay here. To come close to the points with ones’ neck and say: throat,
say: it trembles, say: to bury into a voice. Think out loud,
together, bloodstream, now, on the spoken as a lesser share,
on the rain in the ocean, and always remaining like this; not having many,
neither seas, nor horizons, all kinds of lines, all kinds of years, before
something, before the list goes on ease off, to renounce
mass, earth, because it attracts, you, because you attract, the axles, because
they spin, necks because of heads, aisles, because they’re in line,
faces because of mouths, eyes because of names, not to logic,
neither enterprises, nor work. To abolish by choice and continue
to stay. Not to leave, when the wind pours in, dispersed on
the insides and the worlds, it pours in also where you don’t anticipate it yet.
To no attend by leaving, to distinguish a lot of water.
—
I had in my voice fresh leaves,
wildlife lying in wait, put out to pasture.

Ko se še enkrat ne

Gledal sem se,
kako te je bilo vse manj,
kako ne glede na marec pada,
na Juarroza molči,
nate ne obstaja.
Gledal sem v temi fosforescentne
napise, vire svetlobe brez utehe.
Ponoči, sam v vrsti, v oddelkih,
videl delno, videl osupel, pri miru,
kako sta enako v razmiku let sijali:
la tierra se abrio, in:
Španija, bela pod snegom.
Nekaj izmišljenega vztraja,
nekaj resničnega pade topo ob tla.

Najdlje ostati in ne reči.
Najdlje želeti, bolj želeti,
najdlje govoriti,
najdlje sanjati eno in isto,
najdlje končati, ne da bi
se ulilo, čez travo, čez
asfalt, čez reke, po vseh.
Najdlje trepetati ob tem,
najdlje ponavljati ne.
To meriti s časom.
Kot potek, kot vreme,
stisk rok, udarec, kot nekoč.
In meriti srepo, kolikor
lahko, zapostaviti
dejstva, s krovom, s kričanjem,

spet, kolikor dolgo blazni,
učiti se gibov, krajev, manj,
likov, trenirati spomin, sebe
obremeniti, čez, žar, čir, mak,
med, led, postopno, ampak zares
izginiti in se narediti sami.

»Včasih se ne morem več premakniti.« R. Juarroz
Včasih sem znal vse živo:
številke na jadrih konkurentov,
črkovati tujke, preganjali so me
verzi, ki so se iz Tomaža usuli na
papir in s papirja name.
Če sem kaj videl, je bilo to prvič:
oči so se mi raztapljale in izgorele.
Včasih sem znal, koliko verzov je
vsaj deset slovenskih pesnikov in
pesnic potrebovalo za prvo knjigo.
Prešteval sem po vsakem svoje.
Bil je čas, ko se je svet razprl kot
sadež in vse natančno in marljivo
čakanje se je lahko končalo.
Dovolj je bilo spustiti prijem, našel
sem nekaj, od česar bi se odrinil.
Izgledalo je kot v trdi temi delati med
ljudmi kretnje in ob nikogar zadeti.
Govorila sva si: moja neskončna milina.
Zrak je dišal grenko. Stvari, ki so nerazločno
prehajale, se akumulirale, se nekje znašle …
drugo so požrli verzi in verze svet. In ostanejo
mi samo stvari, ki jih:
iščem, iznajdem, ne požrem.
Ne da bi s tem razrezal kaj mrtvega, ki vztraja,
neko količino tebe, ki boli. Če se premaknem,
neprenehoma zadevam ob nekaj,
kar odmeva, je nepropustno, ne prepoznam,
ločen, nima z mano, živi in se približam,
in se od blizu in se v življenju in se od nekdaj,
in vsakič ne pusti preimenovati.

30

—
Škoda papirja.
—
Kar pride zanesljivo, ljudje so.
Prav bi bilo se nečemu odreči:
načinu prihodov,
soli, ki ni groba,
temu, kako misliš nanj,
življenju v svojem delu,
jezikom, v katerih ne rečeš strah,
časom preobilja.
Treba je nekaj ponavljati dolgo
in izpasti.
Zajemati vodo v dlani, videti skozi mrene,
skozi sebe, živo mejo, živi pesek, živež,
žled, skozi zdavnaj, tisto okleščeno in ostro.
Po novem namesto drugje reči zdravo.
Enako ne biti tam in tu.
—
Ne nujno nekam
—
Jeklenke druga ob drugi,
stvari dvigniti s tal in zastati,
jih odložiti naključno, sebe
odvreči, stran, kjer si iskal,
niti, tako, da nihče ne ostane
dlje, v položaju, preveč ste
blizu, vriniti se, izbrisati z
novo črto, z več nepreglednim,
več jutri, manj, veliko manj
izostanki.
Biti tu, naj to pomeni karkoli.
—

Med gladinama jeklo, vzgon in
navoji, mesto za zrak, otrplost
za spust, ločitev za osip. Toliko,
da ne poči, tako razločiti sebe
od telesa, od govora, od vloge,
od olike, od tebe. In dovoliti,
da pod pritiskom tudi poči.

ozreš, kot bi se nečesa dotaknil, opoldan, po dežju,
pri zaviranju in šelestenju, pri znakih inercije, sledeh
spomina, mrtvila, grobo reči odskok, tiho čakati v
praznini. Ti med vsemi, ti ob njem, ti nedoumljivo,
ti prav tako, ti se razume, ti nihče ne uide, ti dobro veš.

—

Spisati tripartitno.
Določiti obveze, ohraniti jezo.
Ne odpuščati: ne listom, ne svetu, ne ljudem,
ne trepetati, ampak ne oditi, ampak, ampak
brati: drhtim, brati: kot zrak, brati: enako.
Ostati na istem mestu tudi, ko se premaknejo:
nekaj najbolj pri miru, osebno, tudi če gre za
tla, za plošče, za ravni, korenine mest, najbližjo
temo, največkrat v mraku ponovljeno, največ dreves,
največkrat v oči, tudi če se tega vsakič potem spomniš.
Tukaj ostati. Se ostem približati z vratom in reči: grlo,
reči: se trese, reči: zakopati v glas. Misliti na glas,
skupaj, krvotok, zdaj, na izgovorjeno kot manjši delež,
na dež v oceanu, in vedno ostajati tako; ne imeti mnogih,
ne morij, ne obzorij, vsakršnih črt, vsakršnih let, pred
čem, pred vsem naštevanjem popustiti, se odpovedati
masi, zemlji, ker privlači, tebi, ker privlačiš, osem, ker
vrtijo, vratovom zaradi glav, osmim, ker so v vrsti,
obrazom zaradi ust, očem zaradi imen, logiki ne,
ne podjetjem, ne delu. Ukiniti po izbiri in še naprej
ostati. Ne oditi, ko se usuje veter, razpršeno po
notranjostih in svetu, se usuje tudi, kjer še ne slutiš.
Z odhajanjem ne prisostvovati, razlikovati ogromno vode.

Tako reči ne.
—
To je na površini, kjer čutim,
in omrtvim.
Spodaj nekaj shrani zelo mirno
morje, ki toplo hlapi in se ovija.
Vstopi prazno, v oko in med osi.
Neveljaven, pulim ostanke, v
sporu osi zanihajo, blago, če je
tren, se pravi, zadostuje iti z roko,
vanj, prepričati se, se ne predati,
se ja vzeti, se vreči, rezultirati,
silo pokazati na sebi, do kje, in
ko je ni, do kam, te ni.
Z neko težo se grabiva
in teža ve, da prevlada.
—
V resnici se ne bojim ničesar,
tega se bojim zdaj in ves čas.
Slovenski pesnik kliče mladega slovenskega pesnika.
Pička ti materinščina, svetovni dnevi, obeležja,
uporaba zgodovine, trenutkov, naporov, kontre,
blodi, gams, kriv, krčiti kolena, rezget konj, se
zgruditi na tla, požreti, požreti vse to, se svita, v
množini, enačiti držo s črko, zakon, moraš, moraš,
moraš ponavljati, ponavljati sebi, ob uri dneva, ob
tem, da živiš, neprestano, obenem, obist, obenem z
zmoto, z ustnicami in topi, krogi, ki se jim samo

Light

Luč

Light lights itself,
so that darkness shines.
So that there is no darkness, no light.
Because the light in the room is not light.
But light darkness.
In the hands of darkness.
Not in your hands.

Luč se prižge sama,
da zasveti tema.
Da ni teme ne svetlobe.
Ker svetloba v sobi ni svetloba.
Ampak svetla tema.
V rokah teme.
Ne v tvojih rokah.

You have memories of all the places.
Memories you don’t always remember.
Under your skin, memories of impressions
that went into you from the place.
That open themselves to you, when you’re in the place.
So you think that the place knows about you.
So you don’t know that it doesn’t.

Na vsak prostor imaš spomine.
Spomine, ki se jih vedno ne spomniš.
Podkožne spomine na vtise,
ki so šli iz prostora vate.
Ki se ti odprejo, ko si v prostoru.
Da misliš, da prostor ve zate.
Da ne veš, da ne ve.

Room

Soba

If the room is the same when you return
If the walls are white-washed with the same whiteness
If there are the same un/read books on the shelves
and only you are different from your past self
then the sameness is above your difference
above your time
it is the same time of the same space

če je soba v katero se vrneš ista
če so stene pobeljene z isto belino
če so na policah iste ne/prebrane knjige
in samo ti si od nekdanjega sebe drug
je istost nad tvojo drugostjo
nad tvojim časom
je istega prostora isti čas

Things

Stvari

Alone

Sama

Around you are the tongs of things.
Tongs of clocks, counting up and down your time.
Tongs of doors, closing your openness.
Ceiling’s tongs, the clamped down sky above you.
You barely know
how they hold you, tongs of things
of your own creation.

Okrog tebe so klešče stvari.
Klešče ure, ki ti sešteva in odšteva čas.
Klešče vrat, ki ti zapirajo odprtost.
Klešče stropa, ki je ukleščeno nebo nad tabo.
Še sam dobro ne veš,
kako si v kleščah stvari,
ki si jih sam ustvaril.

When we’re together,
we’re even more alone.
Each of us alone inside oneself.
Another to one another.
How close with you,
with you so close.
How far?

Ko sva skupaj,
sva še bolj sama.
Vsak sam v sebi.
Drug drugemu drug.
Kako blizu s tabo,
ki si blizu.
Kako stran?

34

When she is

Ko je ona

When she is for you yours.
When you are for her hers.
When you go with your fingers shut
over hers.
When your world is on this world
because of her world.
When hers is here because of yours.

Ko je ona zate tvoja.
Ko si ti zanjo njen.
Ko greš s prsti, ki mižijo,
čez njene.
Ko je tvoj svet na svetu
zaradi njenega sveta.
Ko je njen zaradi tvojega.

have you ever had anything taken by force
what you had beside you inside you for yourself
what you wouldn’t for no money
let go from your hands
it went into another hands
whose hands can love like mine
(you asked your hands)
you asked your fingers on hands
with pads of fingers

ti je bilo kdaj na silo vzeto
kar si imel ob sebi v sebi zase
kar nisi za noben denar
hotel spustiti iz rok
je šlo v druge roke
čigave roke lahko ljubijo kot moje
(si vprašal svoje roke)
si vprašal svoje prste na rokah
z blazinicami prstov

By yourself

Sam s sabo

By yourself you’re not alone.
By yourself you’re with yourself.
By yourself there are two of you.
In each of us there are two of us,
so that one is not alone,
when he is by oneself.
So that he is not by oneself.

Sam s sabo nisi sam.
Sam s sabo si s sabo.
Sam s sabo sta dva.
V vsakem sta dva,
da eden ni sam,
ko je sam s sabo.
Da ni sam s sabo.

BEHIND YOUR BACK

Za tvojim hrbtom

Clowns nailed to the moon,
painted Harlem black,
Janez the black,
moves his legs,
in order to run away,
behind your back
an Amish goes to a rave party,
he's dressed
as if he'd lost a bet,
as if he was followed
by tight briefs on a male's ass,
shards of wine bottles trampled into the mud,
violets in lonely april,
married virgins
and a Taiwanese girl
who thinks
I'm Ronald Reagan,
behind your back
the dust lures tears out of Keops' dreams,
a neighbour levitates in the corner,
the Khmer Rouge sink paper ships
and a princess solving sudoku in the john.
They're there
the questions and the river,
devoured by a giant grey flower,
Moscow is small behind your back.
Where are you, the plump and irregular,
the rude and unstable,
where are you drunks and sleepwalkers,
gamblers and pickpockets.

Klovni, prikovani na mesec,
so prebarvali Harlem na črno,
črni Janez,
premika noge,
da bi zbežal,
za tvojim hrbtom
gre Amiš na raveparty,
oblečen je,
kot bi izgubil stavo,
kot bi mu sledile
oprijete kopalke na moški riti,
črepinje vinskih flaš poteptane v blato,
vijolice v osamljenem aprilu,
poročene device
in majhna Tajvanka,
ki misli,
da sem Ronald Reagan,
za tvojim hrbtom
prah izvablja solze iz Keopsovih sanj,
sosed lebdi v kotu,
rdeči Kmeri potapljajo ladjice
in princesa na sekretu rešuje sudoku.
Tam so
vprašanja in reka,
ki jo požira velika siva cvetlica,
Moskva je majhna za tvojim hrbtom.
Kje ste, okrogli in nepravilni,
neotesani in neuravnovešeni,
kje ste, pijanci in mesečniki,
kvartopirci in žeparji.

38

Where are you, brawlers and firestarters,
where are you,
to die of sadness,
to strangle the sun
and the albatross,
targeting american presidents.
Behind your back
are Kenyans, Israelites, siptars,
Norwegians, lilliputians, chavs and gringos,
you're prettier than a can of beans,
don't turn back,
they're there
hard-working, lazy, toadies, polyglots,
teachers, numbskulls, pyromaniacs, perverts and
diletants,
there is a baby,
who's afraid of the needle,
a teacher,
who noticed
the stoned teenagers in the last bench,
there's Ozzy Osbourne and the pigeon,
and the dude with the shovel,
a crying widow
and love with a shovel of earth, spread over eyes and
mouths,
the city is full of people and flies,
I'd invite you,
but didn't know
you gulped,
I remember how heavy your head lies in my lap,

Kje ste, pretepači in požigalci,
kje ste,
da bi umrli od žalosti,
da bi zadavili sonce
in albatrosa,
ki leti nad ameriške predsednike.
Za tvojim hrbtom
so Kenijci, Izraelci, šiptarji,
Norvežani, liliputanci, čefurji in gringosi,
lepša si od konzerve prebranca,
ne ozri se,
tam so
delavni, leni, hlapci, poligloti,
učitelji, teleta, piromani, perverzneži in diletanti,
tam je otročiček,
ki se boji igle,
učiteljica,
ki je opazila,
da so v zadnji klopi mulci zadeti,
tam sta Ozzy Osbourne in golob,
pa možakar z lopato,
objokana vdova
in ljubezen z lopato zemlje, razgrnjene prek oči in ust,
mesto je polno ljudi in mušic,
saj bi te povabil,
a nisem vedel,
da goltaš,
spomnim se, kako težka je tvoja glava v mojem
naročju,
kako vroča tvoja sapa na mojem vratu,

how hot your breath on my neck,
how thin your panties,
when I bite your lip.
When I close my eyes,
god opens them.
I grow up very slowly,
I lose you fast,
like a scarf,
an umbrella,
a small beer,
like keys to a mailbox,
and when I open my eyes,
god closes them.
Behind your back is that,
which is so easy to believe,
lies instead of hatred,
how lucky we are,
that there are so many things behind your back,
which
we
can
hate.

kako tanke so tvoje hlačke,
ko te ugriznem v ustnico.
Ko zaprem oči,
jih bog odpre.
Odraščam zelo počasi,
izgubljam te hitro,
kot šal,
kot dežnik,
kot malo pivo,
kot ključe od nabiralnika,
in ko odprem oči,
jih bog zapre.
Za tvojim hrbtom je tisto,
čemur je tako lahko verjeti,
laži namesto sovraštva,
kakšno srečo imamo,
da je za tvojim hrbtom toliko stvari,
ki
jih
lahko
sovražimo.

AN EVENT ON 44th STREET

Pripetljaj na 44. ulici

Sometimes a beer and a freckled girl are enough,
Sometimes your soft ass is enough Robert,
Sometimes I scratch just under my eye and think to myself
Why did you go with me
He had a Mercedes,
I have just traces of marihuana in my piss
And some plans with your pussy.
Could it be enough, that I just care for you.

Včasih sta dovolj pivo in pegasto dekle,
Včasih je dovolj tvoja mehka rit Robert,
Včasih se popraskam tik pod očesom in si mislim,
Zakaj si odšla z mano,
On je imel mercedesa,
Jaz pa imam le sledi marihuane v urinu
In nekaj načrtov s tvojo piško.
Ni menda dovolj le to, da te imam rad.

I LOST MYSELF

Izgubil sem se

I lost myself
Countless times
I lost myself yesterday
In your bed
Amid the story I was selling to you
Amid cucumbers on the market,
The only one,
In the middle of Slavoj Žižek’s lecture,
Not the only one.
I lost myself,
When I searched for warmth,
The truth,
Love,
The plumber.
I searched for answers,
Solace,
A father.
You disappear,
Turn on the TV,
Roam off,
Fade out,
Forget,
Turn off the TV,
Shut your eyes,
Begin to cry.
It’s increasingly easier to find the way out,
It’s increasingly harder out there.

Izgubil sem se,
Neštetokrat,
Izgubil sem se včeraj,
V tvoji postelji,
Med zgodbo, ki sem ti jo prodajal,
Med kumarami na tržnici,
Edini,
Med predavanjem Slavoja Žižka,
Ne edini.
Izgubil sem se,
Ko sem iskal toplino,
Resnico,
Ljubezen,
Vodoinštalaterja.
Iskal sem odgovore,
Uteho,
Očeta.
Izgineš,
Prižgeš televizor,
Odtavaš,
Zamegliš,
Pozabiš,
Ugasneš televizor,
Zamižiš,
Zajočeš.
Čedalje lažje najdem pot ven,
Čedalje težje je tam zunaj.

Come. Make love to me, perfection.
A hardly-touching love.
My nipples hurt. The radio keepsssscratching with every ss the dj makesss but
your slippery thoughts transsing themselves into words that accurately slip and
accurately stop on the spots where they dilute the hurt. Not this much is
needed, not this much, really.
Just a second. A second thought
where your fingers show me: hold on.
And I will hold on
and I will hold my horses, Perfection. ;)

no need to speak
almost no need to move
an urge to breath
a passion for BEING
and a
deep-under-standing
that WHY is just a question of surface
and a complete blackhole waste of

are spreading into the night
with the sound of mass conquering vacuum sphere
nobody noticed anything
he would, maybe,
if he cared but
magic isn't something you should pay attention to
magic you should be

where you are, my friend, where i can be cautious

Perhaps mogoče peut-être if i was an angel če bi bila angel que si j'étais ange da sam anđeo it would be easier for

comprendre i razumljivije to understand or if i was human ali če bi bila človek ou si j'étais homme ali nisam but i

I want to know it all,
all about me, about you, about all the people that are about to live, about the
buried fiddlers,
I want to speak all languages and talk to every human every night.
I want to sleep with every man and every woman, I want to walk along every
path whose roadside rites have not been rubbed off by the hordes of
transitional corpses.
I want to return to the children and the dolphins, but before I do I want
to contemplate things from the rational point of view and make love with all our
hearts, as if they were stretching each over a half of the Earth.
I want to have a quarrel with myself and become a fine human, an honourable
human, a human in all directions, capable of walking in any footwear available,
looking through my and your eyes, at any belfry or centre of the world or sky,
but never crosswise.
I want to become a human in order to be able to go off aloud
in any direction, but not crosswise.
I'm here acting something, not really concentrating on being and on what I'm doing
and why all the others are so much more firmly glued to the scene.
I was born and I'm always complaining, I take myself for granted, just as I take
all of you and my troubles.
I'm starting to think that I should probably be paying a rent because my manner
isn't at all contributing to the community.
Excuse me.

I have always been
too strong for you
to fake it or to take it

Vedno sem bila premočna,
da bi me lahko preigral ali prenesel,

To become a human so I can walk away loudly
and only then I'll be able to walk away.

and I have always been too fragile
to handle
the candle burning
in between the quick shifts
you were always turning,
yearning for love, nauseous for an embrace,
scarred and scared of these, both to death,
of course,
and both until the day you die, until the day
the fake self clicks and ceases, and finally sweetness
makes the grouchy steps grow faint again;
it is a complicated thing
for we can only keep each other company
through tunnels angels strain
for where people and things are so
hard they can almost be held
one can always get too clumsy.
… you call someone by name
and Someone can always turn
around too quickly not to sketch an elbow end in
between the ribs, starting the scintillant candle flame
turn red and leak on the wooden floor, lignify
everyone else in the bar who has been stopped
by the moment of gross, clumsy forgetfulness;

in prekrhka,
da bi zdržala
svečo goreti
med obrati,
ki so te sukali,
težko pričakujočega, a vsakič bruhajočega v objeme,
kakršni so ti bili zadali smrtne rane, zato smrtni srh,
seveda,
in zato oboje do smrti, do dneva, ko tvoj
namišljeni ti zašteka
in neha in sladkost končno spet
onesvesti godrnjajoče korake;
zapletena reč je, ker se lahko druživa
samo skoz tunele, ki jih napenjajo angeli,
ker tam, kjer so zadeve in ljudje
dovolj trdi, da naj bi se jih dalo držati,
se da vedno kaj prenerodno.
Nekoga pokličeš po imenu
in Nekdo se vedno lahko obrne
prehitro, da ne bi zarisal konca
komolca med rebra, kar zardeči svetleči
plamen sveče, ki rdeč začne kapljati na lesena tla,
zaleseni vse v klubu,
ustavljene zaradi te surove, nepozabne nerodnosti;

and any
no my god,
I'm sorry
cannot outlive the outline.

ne, moj bog,
oprosti,
je videti preprosto
manj obstojen
kakor to.

I'd been halved.
One hand wanting to attain you,
the other wanting to
keep us both safe; this was the one

Napolovljena sem bila.
Ena roka mi je segala po tebi,
druga je hotela
le oba obvarovati; ta je ta,

that removed the distortion
and wiped up the leavings
after me
and after you.

ki je na koncu odstranila distorzijo
in pobrisala ostanke
za teboj
in za menoj.

We left the table with less faith
but undoubtedly a lot safer,

Gledališče sva zapustila z ne toliko vere,
ampak nedvomno dosti varnejša,

as leaking faith had left Hansel-and-Gretel traces
all the way back down.

ker so bili predrti upi v žepih Janka in Metke puščali sledi
vso pot nazaj do dol.

»During the sexual act the woman is
considered solely as a body,
which endangers her soul.«
Luce said.

»Med spolnim odnosom je ženska
dojeta kot zgolj telo,
kar spravlja v nevarnost njeno dušo.«
je rekla Luce.

Turn around, Luce.
Take your pants off, Luce.
Panties too, Luce.
Open your legs, Luce.
I make you wet, Luce.
I enter you, Luce.
I'm fucking you, Luce! I'm fucking you!
I massage your tits,
I carress your floppy belly,
I entangle my fingers into your grey pubic hair, Luce.
I spank your downcast ass, Luce.
I pinch your hips, Luce.
I pull on your tom-boy hair, Luce.
I stick my fingers into your french mouth, Luce.
Your body!
Your body is here, Luce.

Obrni se, Luce.
Sleci hlače, Luce.
In hlačke, Luce.
Razširi noge, Luce.
Vlažim te, Luce.
Prodiram vate, Luce.
Fukam te, Luce! Fukam te!
Masiram tvoje joške,
Božam tvoj povešen trebuh,
Zapletam prste v tvoje sive sramne dlake, Luce.
Udarjam ob tvojo uvelo zadnjico, Luce.
Ščipam tvoje boke, Luce.
Vlečem te za tvojo fantovsko frizuro, Luce.
Potiskam prste v tvoja francoska usta, Luce.
Tvoje telo!
Tvoje telo je tukaj, Luce.

Your body is here,
But your soul is hidden,
Luce Irrigaray,
Because she is ashamed of you.

Tvoje telo je tukaj,
tvoja duša pa se skriva,
Luce Irrigaray,
ker jo je sram pred tabo.

The stale smell of leftovers is
Annoying, if you're not hungry.
I can't reach your sockets,
Because you're so high.
When you torture me with the filth of happiness,
I think of the black square.

Postan vonj po hrani je
zoprn, če nisi lačen.
Ne dosežem tvojih štekarjev,
ker si tako visok.
Ko me mučiš s svinjarijami o sreči,
razmišljam o črnem kvadratu.

The wind opens my coat and some of the fog escapes.
It's nothing,
I just scream how unhappy my childhood was,
And I'm saved.

Veter mi razpre plašč in iz mene uide nekaj megle.
Nič zato,
le zakričim, da sem imela nesrečno otroštvo
in sem odrešena.

Are you cold, little girl?
Put your lill' hands between your thighs …
It's always warm between your legs.

A te zebe, punčka?
Dej rokce med stegna …
Med nogami je vedno toplo.

All off the blood flowing into your tampons,
Which you veins so desperately lack!

Vsa ta kri, ki se ti steka v vložke,
v žilah ti je pa tako manjka!

It seems that nature
Didn't think of everything after all.
Or, as everyone else,
She only thought of herself.

Izgleda, da narava
le ni mislila na vse.
Oziroma, tako kot vsi ostali,
je mislila samo nase.

Held you under your arm and became a birdy.
Was naked, had power.
Changes concentrated on your
call.
On patience.
On dissing.
On failure.
I lick milk out of your eye-whites.
I focus strongly on this.
Your eyelashes are glued cause of this.
You have problems with dry contacts.
You have problems with seeing me.

Sem te prijela pod roko in postala ptiček.
Sem bila naga, sem imela moč.
Spremembe so bile skoncentrirane na tvoj
poziv.
Na potrpljenje.
Na brukanje.
Na poraz.
Ližem ti mleko iz beločnic.
Močno se osredotočam na to.
Imaš zlepljene trepalnice od tega.
Imaš probleme s suhimi lečami.
Imaš problem videti me.

I just miss you.
I miss you and become nothing.
Is nothing better than not enough.
Is turning you on better than dissing.

Te zamudim.
Zamudim te in postanem nič.
Je nič boljše kot premalo.
Je rajcanje boljše kot brukanje.

Was on to not being had,
But was rejected
And I
Just lay.
Was gorging myself with crap,
In tongues reach.
Let myself be inseminated by bronze cocks.
I thought,
I'm really good at this.
Sluts and faggots seemed velvet to me.
Jesus knelt infront of me all excited and slipped me pennies.
Stuffed them into my piggy-bank of shame.
Pretended to be pregnant,
So that they could rummage my uterus with iron instruments.
They aborted my child.
Recognized him as mine and drowned him.
Ranked a recipe on the Cooking channel with number 3.
The comments were endless.
Death fucked me over, cause she didn't let me die conventionally.
My mother stuffed me back into her cunt and gave birth to someone better.

Me je imelo da me nima,
a me je zavrglo
in sem
samo ležala.
Sem se filala s svinjarijo,
ki je bila na dosegu jezika.
Sem pustila, da me medeninasti kurci oplajajo.
Mislila sem si,
da sem v tem res dobra.
Lajdre in pedri so se mi zdeli žametni.
Jezus je klečal pred mano in mi ves napaljen podajal penije.
Sem jih vtikala v svoj šparovček sramote.
Sem hlinila nosečnost,
da bi mi z železnimi inštrumenti šarili po maternici.
So mi splavili otroka.
Sem ga pripoznala za svojega in utopila.
Sem na Kulinarični Sloveniji ocenila recept s številko 3.
Komentarji so bili nešteti.
Me je smrt zajebala, ker mi ni pustila umreti na konvencionalen način.
Me je mati stlačila nazaj v pizdo in rodila nekoga boljšega.

Eye

Oko

How do you feel, you big
withered and passive,
stooped and on the wrong spots fatty
white girl,
how do you feel when you stand in the dark and
through the crack
watch,
how do you feel when you watch
that dark and foreign body,
how do you feel when you are the eye,
gazing into foreign
exotic
places,
how do you feel when you watch that
sweaty foreign body
of a co-woman, yet a different being
with dark skin and dark eyes,
how do you feel,
when you watch her masturbate in the silence
of a swampy night,
how do you feel,
when you feel yourself?

Kako se počutiš, ti velika
uvela in pasivna,
sključena ter na napačnih mestih tolsta
belka,
kako se počutiš, ko stojiš v temi in
skozi špranjo
opazuješ,
kako se počutiš ko opazuješ
tisto temno in tuje telo,
kako se počutiš, ko si oko,
ki zre v tuje
eksotične
kraje,
kako se počutiš, ko gledaš tisto
preznojeno tuje telo
so-ženske, a drugega bitja
temne polti in črnih oči,
kako se čutiš,
ko jo gledaš masturbirati v tišini
močvirske noči,
kako se čutiš,
ko se čutiš?

Do you like yourself when you carry roes
in a sagging belly?

Si si všeč, ko nosiš ikre
v mlahavem trebuhu?

Do you like yourself when you’re hiding and
you’re sneaking and
straining
your gaze on that alive

Si si všeč, ko se skrivaš in
oprezaš ter
naprezaš
svoj pogled na tisto živo

jerking body,
you, white girl?

drkajoče telo,
ti, belka?

What does that pussy smell like
— did you ever ask yourself, when you stared like this
as into another, foreign world —
and her sweat, her armpits and those unwashed,
unshaven
legs,
you, white girl, huh?

Po čem diši tista pička
— si se to kdaj vprašala, ko si takole zrla vanjo
kot v nek drug, tuj svet —
po čem njen znoj, pa pazduhe in tiste neumite,
neobrite
noge,
ti, belka v temi, a?

Ah …
Dreams, lost in the sand
and
whispers
in deep ebony.

Ah …
Sanje, izgubljene v pesku

Nest

Gnezdo

Stars form a nest
and moss chokes pasts,
under the heavy smell of cedar
I’m dying, I’m being born
in a nest
of morning mist.

Zvezde tvorijo gnezdo
in mah duši preteklosti,
pod težkim vonjem cedrovine
umiram, se rojevam
v gnezdu
jutranje megle.

I lick dew from my mother’s tits
and sleep on my dad’s shoulders
embraced by my daughter-sister from under weird stars
I’m rotting, I’m being born
in a swampy nest
of entangled
astral bodies.

Ližem roso z materinih jošk
in spim na očetovih ramenih
v objemu hčerke-sestre izpod čudnih zvezd
gnijem, se rojevam
v močvirnatem gnezdu
med sabo prepletenih
astralnih teles.

Bitter earth

Ližem sence in

Trpka zemlja

Morning prayer

Jutranja molitev

Lost
in the foam of her
quicksilver
I open, I devour
grey stallions of dreams
and absurdities
dark, lucid
moth-images
that flutter in the night
sky of haughty palaces
and I raffle rivers
murky gullies of myths
and I try to breathe
pure chlorine
amphetamine

icicles of childhood

Izgubljen
v peni njenega
živega srebra
se odprem, požrem
sive žrebce sanj
in nesmislov
temnih, lucidnih
vešč-podob
ki frfotajo po nočnem
nebu domišljavih palač
in žrebam reke
mlačne struge mitov
in poizkušam dihati
čisti klor
amfetamin
methamphetamin
ledene sveče otroštva

Let’s pour some faith into our actions
brothers and sisters
let’s open our astral mouths and let all
past tenses
spill into us
let all future tenses
drench over our
naked
glittering and
hairy bodies
let’s open our veins and live
heroin
cocaine
lsd
let’s open our genitals
and from the ectoplasm, descending this way
on the cold sheets
of our old, urban apartments
build temples, clearings and cedar halls
new hopes
and new desires
and misty phantasms
and feverish orgasms;
every living body mostly hurts

Vlijmo nekaj vere v naša dejanja
bratje in sestre
odprimo naša astralna usta in pustimo naj se
pretekliki
izlijejo v nas
naj se prihodnjiki
cedijo po naših
golih
svetlikajočih se in
kosmatih telesih
odprimo si vene in živimo
heroin
kokain
lsd
odprimo naša spolovila
in iz ektoplazme, ki se bo tako spustila
na hladne rjuhe
naših starih, meščanskih stanovanj
izgradimo templje, jase in cedraste dvorane
nova upanja in
nova hotenja
meglene sanjarije in
vročične svinjarije;
vsako živo telo predvsem boli

And time flies
games, masks fall
into waterways of spaces
narcissistic thoughts
where, with wet past tenses,
they play manifold loves —
and linguistic models
die a silent, timid death
while wild horses
— in a post script to themselves —
as some kind of symbols
wander across the desolate crazy mushroom fields
at night

In čas beži
igre, maske padajo
v vodovja prostorov
narcisoidnih misli
kjer se z mokrimi pretekliki
igrajo raznotere ljubezni —
lingvistični modeli pa
umrejo tihe in plašne smrti
medtem ko divji konji
— v post scriptum sami sebi —
kot neki simboli
blodijo po zapuščenih poljih norih gob

..... ||........ |.. ..
No one is searching for you.
No one cares about you.
Everything you do is pretend.
You know nothing completely.
You’re absolutely clumsy and stupid
And your potential is false and a gloom.
No one loves you.
You think you’re not empty but you’re wrong.
You are empty.
People pity you, and it weakens them
And for that they resent you unspeakably.
There is nowhere where you belong
And no place has been specially prepared for you
Or ever will be.
You intend to accomplish a lot with your
Imprecision and candor
But nothing will happen that could not
As likely have never happened
And the features of yourself you’re most proud
Of will only decompose you like intestinal enzymes.
You will not admit to yourself
What a zealous and noncontributing follower you are.
Others notice, and subjugate you
As easily as a drugged woman.
At the height of your strength
You exhibit all the qualities of a rapist.
You are a rapist
That unconscious girl you so lyrically turned on her side
And tugged down her shorts

60

And squirmed into
You raped.
Your life is over
Yet you linger inanely, drooping
Your raw red eyes and bloated lips
Over the photograph of somebody
Who found you unimportant and meaningless.
Someone who laughed at you
And your bottomless need to pacify.
Your death will come as a surprise to you
Because you are truly stupid.
No one respects you.
There is nothing you say that people
Find interesting. This is why
When you speak, no one comments
And after a pause they move on to a new subject.
Without you.
There is though
The mysterious and unpleasant sedation
People speak of
When you hover in their presence overlong.
Perhaps your one contribution, if it may be called
such.
Long you’ve known that
Your need to express yourself
Makes you even less tangible
And therefore able to be sieved until only the sieve
remains
As crystalline and as pure and as purposeful as ever.

Your crass, indiscriminate mind
Allows you somehow to feel yourself »creative«
And »special« even as you observe everyone
Around you soaring past you
Without a glance.
None of your utterances are memorable
And so you cause pain by betraying
The imbeciles who have not yet recognized
Your total lack of value.
Aping others is your only path.
You are so tired and shapeless.
It’s not unexpected that you can’t
Admit to yourself what a faggot you are.
It’s not unexpected when you fail. It’s briefly relished
And forgotten by your betters.
No one thinks you’re strange, only
Desperate and servile and unfaithful.
Your anemic opinions shift erratically like flies
To importunate each real traveler
With the misfortune to lose their way in your mire.
Where you squat evilly.
Where you are blind and no one will lead you
To the malarial oasis of mediocrity that is your final
Spontaneous, resting place.
It will be, yes, though
Not before you see everything you’ve ever wanted
Being given to others, briefly held and then dismissed
as trivial
As they ascend yet more

To places you’ll never see
And feelings you’ll never feel.
So you crawl to your oasis, becoming
Ever more filthy and repulsive and a liar.
Fuck you.
I am a messenger from heaven.
I am a messenger from hell.
I am a messenger from reality.
You look quite ridiculous bent over this way
Praying to me.
Consider me a void.
That empty part of yourself
Which you may glance upon and ponder impotently.
Your one and only freedom.
And I have been speaking to you
Your whole life.
My one and only freedom.

LOVE
I am very rich, and I am as preposterous
As I am rich, very
Very soon my sky for you will leap and face
The veil
And the veil is
And the forest front
The bailfire of
Detail is silent
Not becoming has become
That is their moan
Agnus Dei
There is an apocryphal story that it will not
Come from its way
A depth filled with water
Filled to the brim with water like a lover
Filled with her lover
You must remember to cover your lover
You must remember to cover your lover
With a blanket or sheet,
Cover him with your furniture womb, thronging
In a circle
Your ranks of pottage, your fruit’s exile.
Kill me.
Stupefy the ex-premier
Of my recent country of inflections,
Or inanition in the ear to hear those that flee
Run with all that is fled, parade of God,
Wordless barley corn swept from the tapedeck,
A mundane dilation of the half open eye.
Hold your squashy pennants while I abrade when I
Hold your expirers
Me for her own,
Who as me
Who I am, progenitor and program
On the curvette of the TV.
Aisling through
With a cross,
It contains.
I take roofies
Flames go up I pass in the gondolet.
You cannot reach, console
Its roasting cannot impede its rising

62

I piss on you my flame
The three circles of Maya
Robes glowing behind garden doors,
On this earthly door
That opens before you, closes
After you
But
You dance, you dance like
A spinning token.
Opening through it,
You will
Open your shattered hole of
Of being
For all its love (and need of love)
Like a baby, an infant,
Lolling your circle against my mouth, I am carried
By a fresh light
And they eat the stars south
By you, the unsoundable sun
Torrents dry on my body
Humming my brocade
For profit. You return from my soul, we make love
And are gone.
To gold interleaves that trim the anterior with rigid
down.
My face, self-effacing.
I am separated wine
Separated
From thirst
That is mine
That wine is mine
Motherhood is mine

tritons and waves carry the nights through the misty
winds and burning wires on the sand, the fisherman

there’s always a way to describe as long as what you’ve
come up to become, what you've done up to now, what
you’ve seen, all you know, all you've lived that don’t

give, all that it takes, all that’s at stake, a single eye
in the jungle, missed the bungle, take zero come ride
you hear, is it real? how things change, how disrupting,
familiar yet strange, together in distance, indecent
thoughts, unjust state, irrelevant claims, annoying bla

Said: That’s the best
Mallarmé duped himself he’s making bombs

Rekel: Dets d best
Mallarmé se je ufural, da dela bombe

Even Šalamun doubted now and then
If he didn’t cul-de-sac himself too much
Knew just what needs to be erased

Še Šalamun je kdaj pa kdaj podvomu
Če se ni preveč zaplezal
Vedel samo, kaj mora sčrtat

And no one knows …

In nihče ne ve …

How to say this?

Kako to povedat?

I’d love to love
Without being there

Ljubi se mi
Ne da bi bil tam

ONE REVOLUTION PER SECOND

ONE REVOLUTION PER SECOND

The experts didn’t get it
Except that it’s moving somewhere

Teoretiki pa niso poštekali
Razen da se nekam premika

»Aimless Slovene
Slovene: 3 dinars«1
Masturbates on the ruins of the Statue of Liberty:

»Brezciljni Slovenec
Slovenec: 3 dinarje«1
Drka na ruševinah Kipa svobode:

Some got intimate without undressing
Pissed on systems that had dressed them

Eni so šli v intimo, ne da bi se slekli
Scali na sisteme, ki so jih oblekli

I blame Julia Primic
»Her breath was my bayonet«
If she just put out
I could’ve changed the planet

Za vse je kriva Primicova Julija
»Tvoj dih je moj bajonet«
In če bi mu dala
Bi lahko spremenil svet

Others just came late — farted old pearls
Into new stuccos. Sold their ideals for higher ordeals
Wrote how they chop tomatoes — how they wash their
sheets

Drugi so zamujali — prdeli stare bisere
V nove štukature. Prodali ideale za visoke položaje
Pisali kako sekajo paradižnike — kako si perejo
rjuhe

He was a great poet
Only when stoned to death
In 2005 he still dug the Romantics
But finally hacked it
You can't cop on luxury all life long

Bil velik poet
Samo ko je bil zadet
2005 se je še vedno fural na novoromantiko
In končno shekal
Da ne morš skoz luksuza pičit

The first drank till dead — just killed themselves
The clever ones moved out, the second got killed by
others
The third stopped by themselves — the fourth choked
on the valley

Eni so se zapili — se sami ubili
Pametni so se izselili, druge so
drugi
Tretji so sami nehali — četrte je zadušila
kotlina

And everybody he should or could have been
Whirled round him as spirits of ancestors:

In vse, kar naj bi bil al moral bit
Je vršalo okrog njega kot duh prednikov:

And the clouds just were
Forming themselves to infinity

In oblaki so kr bli
In se formirali v neskončno

»Janez the humble
Janez the craven
Janez bordered in black«2

»Janez ponižni
Janez strahopetni
Janez črnoobrobljeni«2

More than 10,000 years of high art
Yet the story remains the same:

Več kot 10.000 let visoke umetnosti
Pa še vedno ista zgodba:

Metaphysically dead
2.4 light years from Alpha Centauri

Metafizično mrtev
2,4 svetlobnih let od Alfa Centauri

Homer sipped mushroom-tea
(6th century B.C.)
Suddenly it hit him:

Homer je srkal čaj iz gobic
(6. stoletje pred štetjem)
Naenkrat ga zadane kot sneta sekira:

»VIVA INDIFFERENCE«3
Dante worked his ass off most with Paradise
Rimbaud slept drunk on the beach

»VIVA INDIFFERENCE«3
Dante se je najbolj namatral s Paradisom
Rimbaud je spal pijan na plaži

»EACH MOVE — EACH TUNE OUTFUCKS THE SYSTEM!«
… And we don’t bethink the mud under us
Only the leaves above
And how much we loved them
As they fell …

VSAK GIB — VSAK TON NA KLAVIR ODJEBE SISTEM!
… In ne mislimo več na blato, ki je pod nami
Ampak samo na listje, ki je na njem
In kako zelo smo ga imeli radi
Ko je padalo …

While he poses poetry about poetry
How alone and boohoohoo
Recycles originals
Fights on another plane
Comes on the page and fades out

On pa ti pozira poezijo o poeziji
Kako sam in buhuhuu
Reciklira originale
Se bori na neki drugi ravni
Pride na papir in pol zaspi

Then the pope 3000 years later to a crowd willingly in
the rain:

Potem pa papež čez 3000 let množici prostovoljni v
dežju:

Closes his eyes to make it spond
Somewhere else:

Zapira oči, da bi se skladalo
Nekje drugje:

AVE GRATIA THAT HAD US PLUNDERED
Although Neruda wrote: »Blood runs in streets«
The blood runs in the streets
And even if Dylan wrote:
»GREAT IS THE HAND THAT HOLDS DOMINION OVER MAN
BY A SCRIBBLED NAME«4
Choppers came and burned their skies
»Out of every dead child arose a rifle with eyes«5

AVE GRATIA, KI SI NAS PLENLA
Tud če je Neruda napisal: »Kri teče po ulicah«
Kri teče po ulicah
In tud če je Dylan napisal:

that »SEEING THE POPE IS A CLIMAX«

Žalosten postanem, ko nekdo reče navdušen v kamero,
da je »VIDET PAPEŽA VRHUNEC«

Saved from action
High on abstraction
This probably meaningless agitation

Rešen akcije
Zatripan v abstrakcije
Te verjetno smiselne agitacije

Of some failed inhalation

Neke spodletele inhalacije

Which actually didn’t change much
Except that the State bared its real teeth:

Kar sploh ni sprožlo take spremembe
Razen da je Država pokazala svoje prave zobe:

»Plečnik was a freemason

»Plečnik je bil prostozidar

And beautiful things
Really beautiful things in between
Just cause someone said they were

In lepe stvari
Res lepe stvari vmes
Ker je nekdo rekel, da so

A forgery of a forgery

Plagiat plagiata
Ne da bi bil too sentimental

ÉTUDES FOR THE MOTH IN THE LIGHT BULB
I.
Darkness and moon and night and sheep. This was the world once. Silence and owls and lowing of sheep
The walls between us are thin. Seeping as your mind
And there’s only a wound or this moment. Which you let somehow. Purely through you
As clouds and cold and freshness on skin
If you could see. What you forget inbetween
Someone sings toward Moon. And language: The sound of grass grinding donkeys
Or a sheep’s scream at night and then nothing. A big shadow comes.
Smells the ass of another shadow. Photorealism also don’t work.
As you lose yourself. And forget by the way. On the edge of the always and same abyss
Three animals listening to the scratch of my pen. And their personalities!
The moon scorching through clouds. Falls with a broken and face
I feel like a shepard. And calm as if I’d become the crickets and road
Right here, yes. As if forgetting by the way
And to be the road and house and you. As a lamb slurs into night
Or a horse chewing his grass
Can’t help myself. There is always something as if something if
Stay alone and silent and happy inside you. Stay here a while. Stay outside
Let it be cold. Listen how horses pull the grass more confidently than donkeys
Silent and calm in night, which has completely accepted you by now
(Recreate your drama for yours truly and therefore for all)
As if something would forcefully run out of you. Appear and disappear. Someone
Something unheard of in these rhymes. Stay!
As pulse and rythme of world and a fence tinkling away
How clear and prepredictable apartments seem
That this spirit inside me. As someone else. Overtook. Overtook

4 Dylan Thomas: The Hand That Signed the Paper
5 Neruda: Razlagam par stvari

Flies die on sticky strings
(I stare into them and don’t know who’s there)
As if you would somehow secretly inside you know
That life is renewable. Hidden and safe

That it always comes back. Like flies
He writes in the kitchen. And around his search-light there circles a moth
As his own private fairy

III.

She just stares into the fire

Darkness is all around and silence and somethingness
There’s not even stars, neither candles that could flicker
Not even this likeness, pretending to be the only solution

Maybe it’s a tragedy. I don’t know. I mean
To touch someone without knowing what you bring about
Great misunderstood Rabbit. I don’t know where you come from. Don’t know where you go
What do I know if that I don’t know that?
I don’t know
II.
And there’s no word to forget, that could have changed it all
Me: a red cigarette butt against clouds. Weird towns where you can’t see stars
Bats circling round lanterns and barks furiously toward someone in dark

I think there’s no point adding anything else

IV.
The third night same same. Except for the fog stretching through fields
And the sheep are already much braver. More reconciled. It’s alright
Me thinks. Except if our obsessions only temporarily depart
To some old fireplace at night. As some forget his or her self
For an hour or two (finding his long lost Ophelia desperately lost inside you)

You eat as fire burns. What the night is outside. In your head
You continue where you left of. Dispersit

To see a moment within a moment. Behave as you’d be the first. A pioneer.
Cause you actually don’t know. Maybe you dreamt it all before.
And forgot as you dreamt. Simultaneously with a naive and touching severence.
You play these words. As a hymn to Principle. And every time you pounce inside,
Behind eyes, through you into:

People hidden in their houses
And the moon which I presume I only see
Makes valuable this act. Of some improvisation

Somewhere in the distance sounds of moving bodies I’ll never understand
I enjoy the fact that I’m now still
As nobody. As fire

As if some absolute indestructability would silently hover all around them
And crickets and stars. Too calm to stay in
As is breath and the same air that we breathe
The moon and nakedness before wish and –es
Or the pressure that in houses reigns
Vibrates between histories of women and men
She that hath made fire
Only stares alone into the fire
And the moon that like a chopped off skull
For ever and ever. Only echoes Scream

V.

And an old house and light which in her skin just bathes
The sheep tries. Gurgles into night
And somewhere high
A plane inaudiably flashes
That can not be a star

74

Maybe the lambs call the moon at night and she comes
The clouds open her just for you. Spit trickles down your chin. Rain maybe
But in any case crickets
And when she sets. She houses paints
And lightning far off
Strikes
VI.
You ask a question. You gaze into the fire. And life itself is the answer
When you go and piss into the darkness. And the peace outside. Is memory which gathers you.
A certain nervousness when you break off and grab the pen.
How must it have been to be man here without light? Darkness and sounds and stars

(In fact a book should never end: that’s the idea)
What is a house? What a bed, given this?
VII.
She is not a face or the shape of her body. Although it’s an engine you don’t drive
The lack of habit. Which can’t help itself in any other way
Than to wait for you
He might altough only celebrate his own destructability
In the realm of a certain western tradition
And this feeling is only one percent of what you can feel
If you’re a butanese master of levitation
I want to know where you live
There are flowers and there are graves
What are trees and meadows if you love someone 1500 km away?
My tears dry toward sun
Dressed in security of some calm silent étude
Or bounded in a nutshell. As you leave your room behind. Or house or world
When you hover. You don’t know you hover. You’re just so calm
It takes you away. And you don’t even feel how it takes you away
VIII.

BUY A CAT FOR A MILLION EUROS, fall silent. You’re hypersensing.
You try to relax. Not to think the too much outside
Mountains bare. You breathe heavily, one with the machine.
You feel every shake as if it where your own body.
Every curve. Outside »infinity«. You can’t stand it. You close. You pray.
You pray the only prayer you know. You pray to the pilot and to human genius.
To yourself and to fate you pray. To survive
You’re afraid you could die and never complete your masterpieces. The stewardess sets you free.
She brings water. You’re squeezing the napkin. Thinking how it is compared to the clouds
X.
Are they so calm because they don’t even know that they are?
Underneath the earth is divided. Into worries and their people
But up here only white shifting constantly passing
With slight periods of turbulence. And of course you like it
If all of this is a part of you

ETIDE ZA MOLJA V ŽARNICI
I.

»A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien
Bergère ô tour Eiffel le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin«
Finally you take off. Freedom and light envelope you. A tear rises, flows behind glass.
Ljubljanese on the plane try to preserve this moment on their digital cameras. You rise.
You’re in the air now. Feel pressure in ears. You feel like at the ascencion.
No more roads. No houses. Only lines of mountains. Colours dressed in fogs.
Water flows through the windows. Through your eyes.
You see only the machines’ wing. It carries you
Everything else is the blue yearned for by renaissance masters
Now you’re above clouds. And all is one anyway. You see a line. You can say: horizon
IX.

Tema in luna in noč in ovce. To je nekoč bil svet. Tišina in sove in blejanje ovc
Zidovi med nami so tanki. Pronicljivi kot tvoja zavest
In je samo rana ali ta trenutek. Ki ga spustiš nekak. Čisto skozse
Kot oblaki in hlad. In svežina na tvoji koži
Če bi videl. Kar vmes pozabiš
Nekdo zapoje proti Luni. In jezik: zvok trave, ki jo melje osel
Ali krik ovce v noč in potem tišina. Ena velika črna senca pride
Povoha rit drugi senci. Fotorealizem tud ne funkcionira
Kot bi se zgubljal. In sproti pozabljal. Nad vedno istim prepadom

Although you just took off. You’d be glad to land
Outside where everybody, not reading newspapers, looks: MASSACRES IN UZBEKHISTAN

76

Tri živali, ki v senci poslušajo šum tega penkala. In njihove osebnosti!

Luna, ki zažiga skoz oblake. Pada. Zlomljenega in obraza
Kot pastir se počutim. In mirno kot bi se zlil s črički in cesto
Tukaj ja. Kot bi se sproti pozabljal
In bit cesta in hiša in ti. Kot bacek, ki blekne v noč
Ali konj, ki svojo travo melje
Ne znam si pomagat. Vedno je nekaj kot nekaj kot
Ostani sam in tih in srečen v sebi. Ostani tukaj še malo. Ostani zunaj
Pusti, da te zebe. Poslušaj kako konji pulijo travo bolj samozavestno kot osli
Tiho in mirno v noči, ki te je sprejela. Zdaj že popolnoma vase
(Poustvari svojo dramo samo zase. Torej za vse)

Ješ kot ogenj gori. Kar je noč tam zunaj. V tvoji glavi
Nadaljuješ kjer si ostal. Dispersit
Ljudje skriti po svojih hišah
In luna, ki jo mislim, da jo vidim samo jaz
Dela vreden ta zapis. Neke improvizacije
Kot da okoli njih tiho lebdi nekakšna absolutna neuničljivost

Kako jasna in prepredvidljiva so stanovanja

In zvezde in črički. Premirni, da bi v njih ostal
Kot je dih in isti zrak, ki ga dihamo
Luna in slečenost pred željo in -ami
Ali pritiska, ki vlada v hišah
Vibrira med zgodovino ljudi
Ona, ki je ogenj naredila
Samo strmi v ogenj sama
In luna, ki kot odčesnjena lobanja
Za vedno in vedno. Samo odmeva Krik

Da je ta duh v meni. Kot nekdo drug. Prevzel. Prevzel

In stara hiša in svetloba, ki se v njeni koži kopa

Muhe umirajo na lepljivih trakovih
(Gledam jih in ne vem kdo je not)
Kot da bi nekak skrito v sebi, za sabo
Vedel, da je življenje obnovljivo
Skrito in varno. Da se vedno vrne kot muhe
On piše v kuhni. In okoli njegove search-lightke
Kroži nočni metulj kot njegova privatna vilinka

Ovca proba. Zagrgra v noč

Ona pa samo buli v ogenj

Mislim, da nima smisla kaj dosti več povedat

Mogoče je tragedija. Ne vem. Mislim
Se dotikat drugih in ne vedet kaj povzročiš

Tema je vsenaokrog in tišina in ničevost
Še zvezd ni, niti sveče ki bi prasketala
Niti tega približka, ki se pretvarja, da je bil edina rešitev

Kot bi nekaj iz tebe sunkovito bežalo. Se pokazalo in izginlo. Nekdo
Nekaj neslišanega v teh rimah. Ostani!
Kot utrip in ritem sveta in ograja, ki žvončklja

Veliki nerazumljeni zajec. Ne vem ne od kod si. Ne kam greš
Kaj sploh vem. Če tega ne vem?
Ne vem
II.
In ni besede, ki bi jo pozabil in bi vse spremenila
Jaz rdeč ogorek proti nebu. Čudno mesto kjer se ne vidi več zvezd
Netopirjev, ki krožijo okoli lantern in lajanja besno proti vonju nekoga v temi

78

In nekje visoko
Letalo neslišno utripa
Ki ne more bit zvezda
III.

IV.
Tretjo noč je vse enako. Razen megle, ki se vleče čez pašnike
In ovce so že bolj pogumne. Bolj sprijaznjene. Vse je v redu
Se mi zdi. Razen če nas naše obsesije. Samo začasno zapustijo
Ob kakšnem starinskem kaminu. Kot nekdo, ki se pozabi nekje
Za urco al dve (in najde spomin po svoji daljni Ofeliji daljno zgubljeni v sebi)
Videt trenutek v enem trenutku. Se obnašat kot bi bil prvič. Kot pionir

Ker dejansko ne veš. Mogoče si vse skupaj že nekoč sanjal
In pozabil kot da bi sanjal. Hkrati naivno in z nekakšno ganljivo strogostjo
Igraš te besede. V hvalnico Principu. In vsakič znova planeš vase za oči
Skoz vase v:
Nekje v daljavi so zvoki gibajočih teles, ki jih nikoli ne bom razumel
Uživam v dejstvu, da zdaj mirujem
Kot ogenj. Kot nihče

Hočem vedet kje živiš. Tam so rože in tam so grobovi
Kaj so drevesa in travniki, če ljubiš 1500 km stran?
Moje solze suhe proti soncu
Oblečena v varnost kot v mirnost neke tihe etide
Or bounded in a nutshell. Kot pustiš sobo za sabo. Ali hišo in svet
Ko lebdiš. Ne veš da lebdiš. Samo tako miren si. Da te odnese
In sploh ne čutiš. Kako te odnese

V.

VIII.

Mogoče pa backi ponoči kličejo luno in pride

»A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien
Bergère ô tour Eiffel le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin«

Oblaki jo odprejo samo zate. Slina se ti cedi z ust. Dež mogoče
Ampak v vsakem primeru črički.
In ko zaide. Hiše slika
In strela nekje daleč
Udari
VI.
Nekaj sprašuješ. Gledaš ogenj. In življenje samo je odgovor
Ko greš in lulaš v temo. In mir tam zunaj. Je spomin, ki te nabere
Živčnost, ko se odcepiš in primeš za penkalo
Kako je blo bit človek tukaj brez luči? Tema in zvezde in zvoki
(V bistvu se knjiga naj ne bi nikoli končala: to je ideja)
Kaj je hiša? Kaj postelja potemtakem?
VII.
Ona ni obraz ali oblika njenega telesa. Čeprav je stroj, ki ga ne voziš
Odsotnost neke navade. Ki si ne zna pomagat drugače
Kot da čaka nate
Mogoče pa samo praznuje svojo uničljivost
V sklopu zahodne tradicije
In ta občutek je samo 1 % kar lahko čutiš
Če si butanski mojster lebdenja

80

Končno vzletiš. Svoboda in sonce te oblije. Solza se dvigne, steče za šipo
Ljublančani na avionu lovijo ta občutek na svojo digitalno kamero
Dvigaš se. Zdaj si v zraku. Pritisk maš v ušesih. Počutiš se kot ob vnebovzetju
Ni več cest. Nič hiš. Samo obris gora. Barve oblečene v megle. Voda teče čez okna. Čez tvoje oči
Vidiš samo še krilo stroja. Nosi te
Ostalo je modrina, ki so jo iskali renesančni mojstri
Zdaj si nad oblaki. In je itak vse eno. Vidiš črto. Lahko rečeš: obzorje
IX.
Čeprav si ravnokar vzletel. Bi najraje že pristal
Zunaj kamor gledajo vsi, ki ne berejo časopisov: POKOLI V UZBEKISTANU
KUPI MAČKO ZA MILIJON EVROV utihnejo. Postajaš hipersenzibilen
Skušaš se sprostit. Ne mislit na preveč tam zunaj
Gore so gole. Težko dihaš, stopljen s tem strojem
Vsak tresljaj čutiš kot da je tvoje telo
Vsak ovinek. Zunaj »neskončno«. Ne preneseš. Zapreš. Moliš
Moliš edino molitev, ki jo znaš. Moliš pilotu. In človeškemu geniju
In sebi in usodi moliš. Da bi preživel
Strah te je, da bi umrl in nikoli končal svojih mojstrovin. Stevardesa te odreši
Prinese vodo. Stiskaš serveto. Razmišljaš kakšna je v primerjavi z oblaki
X.
So tako mirni, ker sploh ne vejo, da so?
Od spodaj je zemlja razdeljena. Na ljudi in njihove skrbi
Tukaj od zgoraj. Pa samo belo prehajanje
In občasne turbulence. In seveda ti je všeč
Če je vse to del tebe

La tête accompli
At first, nobody noticed the head. It was dismissed as a
visual speck of some kind, a stenciled Banksy imitation,
or a pigeon’s body, killed midair. Perhaps a taco, impaled
on a stick with its entrails spilled out, or possibly a snotfilled floating handkerchief. Maybe vomit. Couldn’t tell.
But then Flora Jenkins let out such a blood-curdling
scream that everyone found it very hard to deny the
fact that they were facing an actual human head,
severed from the torso and jammed on top of a jagged
fence to rot upright.
When Flora first glanced at it, she had found the stuckout tongue disgraceful. Her neck snapped, she looked
away so quick. There was a guy behind some bushes
crouching and jacking off and letting out a series of
sotto voce sighs. She felt molested, being sucked in
such a way into the pre-frontal lobe of the pervert’s
brain. On another level, it struck her as flattering –
it has been a while since she had made a man come
closer. He’s probably harmless, just a lonesome loon,
a momma’s boy, a sob-story in the flesh, rubbing out a
quick one during a cigarette break while at work in the
sewers. A rat, a pig, a man. She looked straight at him,
feeling womanly and strong. I’m not startled by your
indiscretion, not least perturbed by your transgression,
the look seemed to imply. Unfortunately, the liquidated
eyes were no longer capable of discerning the difference
between appearing and seeming to appear. They just
vapidly stared. And something was wrong with that,
Flora concluded. Such a display of female courage tends

82

to frighten the offenders, but this one –
»So, what you’re saying, ma’am … Was there really
someone there? Did you see anyone?«
»Good heavens, no. I’m just saying how it was for me.
Nobody there, just the head. All the libidinal thoughts
banished out of it, forever. What am I saying … I did not
even know the man … was it a man?«
»Yes. A man.«
»Well, I’m sure there were libidinal thoughts in there
at some point in this poor man’s life, so I guess it’s not
too disrespectful to the deceased to accuse him of such
carnality even in the after —«
»Ma’am, could you please focus here, we’re obviously
dealing with a murder.«
»Well, or a suicide?«
Bob Rostroff, the detective who had picked up the call,
did not take Flora’s leaps of imagination too kindly. He
was tired. Hung-over, maybe still drunk.
»Miss Jenkins, are you really finding it likely to be
possible that this man could have managed to decapitate
his-own-self, impale his head on a spike and fling his
body in the trash-can?«
»You found the body?« asked Flora.
»No, no, we haven’t found it,« the detective found
himself in a banal fix, »what I’m trying to say is, that it
is highly unlikely that this man had committed suicide.«
»You have to find the body,« said Flora.
»Of course. Now, about what you saw …«
»It was a fleshy look, ghastly and grossly inviting, with
its tongue out like that, something forbidden, yet

somehow alluring, you know what I mean? It’s like there
was this something there that was wholly impervious to
sight and yet you knew it had no place, no purpose even
being there in the first place. I found that strange, and
by that I mean to say - being so easily drawn to strange
things, I had no qualms about getting a closer look.»
»My god,« exclaimed the detective.
»And once I got closer I could begin to discern the lines
slowly falling into place, yet it all remained primordial
and still for a very long time, a totally tarlike spot of
naiveté, until suddenly bam – lucidity! It’s a human
head without a body. I feel a terrible need to scream.«
»So you screamed.«
»Yes. At first, I screamed.«
»And then?«
»Then I screamed some more.«
»You screamed some more.«
»Yes.«
»And then?«
»Then it moved!«
»What?«
»Just kidding,« said Flora. The detective’s face
remained entirely devoid of jest.
»Then I can’t remember very well.« She brushed off
the failed attempt at humor with a flick of her wrist,
»I venture I was screaming for quite a while. Some
people came closer to see what I was screaming about.
Somebody called the cops. You came. Yes?«
»Nothing else?«
»Well yes, the space and time, these buildings, the
pavement, the random weed fleeing the confines of
concrete, a faint smell of excrement and piss dispersed
into a blast of … lilac? Is it spring already? Sun, there
was the sun.«
»Miss Jenkins, please, spare us with the wonders of
existence, somebody died today and didn’t have to.«
Flora set her gaze upon the sky and lost herself in
thought for a very long time, so long in fact, that Bob
got visibly agitated, having been stuck without reprieve
in such an inert position.
»It’s a good day to die, isn’t it? Good as any?«
—

At first, nobody noticed it. It was a nineties abomination,
geocitied working-sign piece of visual fiasco, rumbling
and ready to lawn-mow your retinas. If there’s a page on
the web, and nobody reads it, was there anything ever
really written there? Who knows, who knows. Amidst
blossoms of jaune aggression, this is what it said.
[caps lock] we are the gilot [double-space] guardians
of international law and order and trust. [enter twice]
we had beheaded mr dd for his implicit complicity in
matters of corporate policy of one corporate subject
named trollman-lax designed to degrade and denigrate
the human condition qed [double-space] the punishment

»You chose a stupid fucking name,« Vera was not
pleased with the name he had chosen. »It does not even
evoke the guillotine, but that firm, what’s it called, for
men’s stuff …«
»Gillette?«
»Yeah, that one.«
»So what? They sell blades, our point still comes across.«
»But it’s a corporation; you’re simply helping with their
brand!«
Michael thought that Vera sometimes got very annoying.
He said so, and then said this. »I don’t think they want
to associate their brand with a beheading, do you? I’m
pretty confident they would get upset over this. Maybe
even garner us some publicity.«
»Well, it’s not that close in any case – I said evokes,
simply evokes in a fair-use kind of way, not as a matter
of copyright infringement. If they, by some chance,
really saw it, they would hold shut.«
»Ok, so what was the problem again?«
»That it evokes a stupid merchandise selling hack
company which is selling blades that could last a
lifetime but are deliberately designed not to, and fails
to evoke a fine instrument of popular justice.«
»It evokes a blade!« yelled Michael, finally having had
enough. »That’s all it needs to evoke. Everybody with
a neck knows what a blade means. That’s it. End of
debate.«

»Also, what is qed?« Vera pronounced it kwed.
»Quod errat demonstrandum – as has been here shown.«
Michael cherished these moments of pedagogy.
»But what has been here shown?«
»That he was implicitly complicit in …«
She interrupted, »yes, you made a statement and at
the end you made it say – the truth of my statement
self-evidently rests upon the fact that I stated it. Which
is weird.«
»Would you please stop,« he knew that she was right
and it made him eager to divert her attention from
logic to aesthetics, »I think it adds a certain flare to
the sentence, I mean, it would appear kind of naked
without it.«
»… the human condition.« She read it out loud and left
out the kwed. »Yeah, ok, maybe.«
»What about the punishment line?« Michael asked.
»It’s good, I like it. Matter-of-factly ironically funny.
Cool.« She let the compliments casually linger, allowing
him to savor the taste of probity before driving in a
stake of ridicule.
»But you misspelled irreversible.«
His eyes froze red. »What? Oh shit, what the fuck is that
a doing there?«
»Can you change it?«
»I don’t know how.«
»A monument to your oversight. How oddly appropriate.«
—
The murderee was one Donald Donald the Second,
a third generation banker from the Upper East Side.
There were few actual laments and plenty of toasts to
his death, but the biggest rage-orgy was brewed and
concocted in little square coffices all across the states
by journo-drones and content mill slaves. They dubbed
it the first violent act of the forthcoming/inevitable/
any-day-now revolution, which could be staved off only
at the expense of some different sorts of taxation rituals
and what many bureaucrats would find as absolute
nightmares. The cops jumped on the bandwagon and
reasserted themselves as a force of oppression, while
the political brass continued issuing statements of
peculiar intent. Everybody felt like something was

84

actually going on.
»Imagination is easily filled with images of terror. I think
that’s a property of space. Grinding mills of reality
clashing in objective intersections. We peek through
slits. Horror is good at widening the rift, in my opinion.«
Flora was hosted on a talk show, as the found head
had turned her into a person of public interest. While
many objected to her stardom on account of finding
something planted in plain sight, many more others
found her genuinely intriguing.
»So what you’re saying, miss Jenkins, is that this –
head – is somehow inherently fused with the American
experience of life itself?«
»That is exactly what I’m saying, Ronald, I’m glad that
you are able to put my thoughts into words so succinctly.
And furthermore, if the head really does vibrate parallel
to our public being, then I’m positive we could all draw
some sort of an enlightening lesson out of it.«
»Such as?«
»I don’t know, what do I know … maybe the simple
realization that it’s not really all that bad.«
»A decapitation is not all that bad?«
»Well, not if it was voluntary?«
»A suicide?«
»We’ve seen stranger things.«
»But still, miss Jenkins, you must admit that a
successful, married man chock full of stimulants and
anti-depressants, as the autopsy report has shown, does
not commit such an extravagant suicide.«
»That’s the right word!« Flora jumped on her seat.
»What word?«
»Extravagant, I’ve been looking for it ever since it
happened. Extravagant, yes. That was an extravagant
self-beheading if there ever was one.«
The host did not know how to respond. An awkward
silence ensued. Flora had to break it.
»Anyway, back to my point, which is, that in the grand
scheme of things, a beheaded American banker is not
that bad. I mean, let’s get serious, we’re not exactly
talking about a JFK here, he was just an ivy clone with
too much money and not enough time left when he
managed to lose his head in the whirlwind of what’s
real. Let’s cherish this improbability and be thankful

that we are still alive.«
»But some say it’s the first expression of the impending
class war.«
»Let me tell you about class war, let me tell you about
that. Firstly – it’s bogus, nothing, void and devoid.
Secondly – the antagonisms of human desire always
find a way to express themselves, always have so and
always will. And thirdly – if the imaginative force of the
American public is capable of such deep reflection upon
a simple piece of meat, then I would like to say I remain
firm in my belief in these people, and expectantly hope
for their best.«
Bob the detective was dismayed. It made no sense.
There was no spotlight. He found himself in a vacuum,
free from all obligations to flounder about pursuing
non-existent leads. He had Flora to thank for that.
Mostly he just stayed in his apartment and waited
for the techs to do their jobs, reading a report after
report on information of no value. Papers filled his
space and he could watch it shrink. No flashes going on
inside his head, no mellowing of barriers, no mills of
concept powdering the grain of insight. Blank. Gone.
Nowhere to look. Flora kept popping up in his mind. He
didn’t know why. To shake her off his thoughts, he tried
contemplating his problem out loud.
»What we got here, what we got here, it’s a head. It’s
a man’s head. A man’s head left on a fence. No real
witnesses. Nobody saw a damn thing. Just the head,
they all did see the head. No body. No clues. Chopped
off with a sharp object with great force, a cleaver, an
axe. Severely damaged post mortem.«
He was looking for an axe-murderer with a passionate
resentment towards heads. Damaged after being cut off
– what the hell did he do with it, kick it around? Punched
it all the way across town grinning at people along the
way, most likely. Batting his fists at his sack. What kind
of a sound does that make? He checked the report. Post
mortem damage: severe, in one blow. Did he run it over
with a car? Great, so his axe-murderer now owns a car.
Narrows it down. Did he throw it off a roof? His chest
began pounding. There was some adrenaline. Did they
check out the roofs?

—
Michael was having an anxiety attack. Vera was as calm
as a sedated leper, very slowly, almost invisibly, falling
apart.
»They know!«
»They haven’t found the body yet.«
»They know!«
»Don’t worry.«
»But we told them we did it!«
»We told them we couldn’t have done it.«
»They know!«
»They can’t prove anything without the body.«
»They can!«
»How?«
»Magic! Dark detective sorcery! Forensic voodoo with
animistic yearnings towards discovery, edged intently
upon definite proof. Call it karma. Or justice. Same
thing.«
They were seated in Flora’s house. She was the only
person they felt they could trust with their story. They
broke in and found themselves comforted by the cat
infested make-shift sanitarium filled with empty flower
pots, ripped up mattresses, and other innuendos to
its owner’s fragile state of mind. It emitted the same
electric smell old hairdryers emit. Instant connections
were made. They had abandoned their apartment for
fear of its exposure to enforcement and had nowhere
to go. Flora’s house came as an asylum in every sense
of the word.
»But, we didn’t even kill him,« replied Vera.
»I did not say truth, I said proof. Those are two different
things – what really happened recedes from our reality
of the present and leaves but a few faint traces of its
ever transpiring behind. These few traces can then be
interpreted in any way imaginable, usually veering as
closely as possible to our notion of truth, thus becoming,
in our mind, sources of proof. Once they become sources
of proof, there is no need for truth anymore, as their
tale becomes fact. I’m not afraid of the truth, Vera,
what frightens me is the burden of proof.«
»Then why talk of justice? You’re concerned with the
law. Not with karma, with the Man!«
»Fate deals an incongruous hand, call it what you like.«

»Now with Fate! Focus, Michael.«
»She’s here.«
Flora was deeply unnerved by the fact that the flour
she had set before her doorstep that very morning now
appeared disheveled. Somebody was here. Somebody’s
feet left flour-prints. Not just one somebody’s, at least
two somebody’s feet left flour-prints. What could they
possibly want to do with Flora? She was disconnected
from the grid, removed from law by inaction, of almost
no body to speak of, with nobody to speak to, and no-one
to speak on her behalf, living on cat-meat and drinking
rain, a being wholly existent in abstentio. She instantly
regretted her newfound public prominence. She wished
to be left alone. To knock on one’s own door …
»Anybody home?«
»Who is this?« Vera managed a housewife’s voice.
»This is Flora Jenkins, I live here.«
»All by yourself?«
»Apparently not. Can I come in?«
»Yes, it’s open.«
She found them huddled in a corner like two bare
turkeys in a feathered coop. Cats didn’t mind them,
and they apparently didn’t mind the cats. Something
else must have frightened them so, something official
and uncaring, a regal malediction, a systemic malady, a
force beyond their own control.
»Are you two by any chance junkies?«
»No, we most definitely are not,« replied Michael.
»Then who are you?« inquired Flora.
Vera stood up and took a deep breath, churning out
a sentence in her mind before committing herself to
saying it out loud. She sought indemnity.
»We are the ones who did not murder Donald Donald!«
»Ok, I believe you,« said Flora, convinced by such
prudent words.
»Really, we didn’ …» continued Vera and stopped,
»what? You believe?«
Flora nodded.
»Just like that? Without a doubt?«
Michael chimed in. »You know we very well could have,
don’t you?«
»We are artists,« added Vera.
Flora’s interest was piqued. »Oh yeah, what kind?«

86

They snuck a glance at each other. Michael was bolder.
»Our work mostly comprises of, also focuses on, auto et
allo-erotic asphyxiation.«
»Wow,« exclaimed Flora. She received two warm smiles
in exchange. »Are you any good at it?«
»We can choke and orgasm almost instantaneously.«
»We thought about setting up a workshop.«
»Which somehow brings us to this … beheading.« said
Flora.
»Well, first, we think that it – as an art-form – deserves
a better name,« said Vera, »so we call it – La Tête
accompli.«
»Bravo!« clapped Flora in excitement.
»We met Donald through craigslist,« explained Michael,
anxious to confront truth, »and he was a very tough
nut to bust. He’s apparently been to every witchdoctor in town, and nothing did anything for him, he
was still emotionally disconnected, burned out and
grinded down, washed up, flushed through, shell of a
man and just a man among many, a simple mannequin
with desires whetted, but all senses dulled. He found no
escape. We had to make him feel. He paid good money
for us to make him feel.«
»So you devised a contraption to perform selfdecapitation during an orgasm? Like a guillotine, but for
adults?« Flora was perspiring with excitement.
Vera stepped in before Michael thought of what to say.
»Well, first, I have to say that I feel as if Michael is
needlessly embellishing certain aspects of La Tête
accompli while intricately laying down euphemisms
across certain other aspects, which I personally find to
be disingenuous and, quite frankly, makes you look like
a fraud.« She raised her hand to silence him. »Because
we need to be clear about something here right from
the start. What happened was in all actuality a very
morose and daring sexual practice, practiced solely by
those with the sensuality of an impromptu genocide.
Beheading came as not only the intended, but also the
desired resolution of events. Basically, what happened
was that this man, Donald, a despicable yeast of a human
being, stood on the edge of the rooftop, masturbated
until climax and at that point Michael lopped off his
head with a hatchet.«
»I knew it!« leaped Flora. »I was positive the moment

I saw it! There was a dirty look on that head’s face.«
»This was of course all pre-arranged and consented to,«
added Michael.
»But the head was not supposed to drop in the middle
of a crowded street! We panicked for fear of official
disclosure, so Michael here got this brilliant idea of
making it look like the whole scene was politically
motivated.«
»Masking passion with politics, makes sense,« reasoned
Flora.
»And we typed up a website where we presented
ourselves as a radical, extremist group intent on
beheading persons of dubious contribution to society at
large …«
»This, when you come to think of it,« interjected
Michael, »would in reality not be an entirely unwanted
occurrence.«
»… and hoped that that would lead any potential
investigators astray,« continued Vera, »I mean, as it is
so obvious that our motives are squarely the opposite of
political, them being artistic and superior and utterly
distanced from the ordinary discourse of hunger and
want, it would be impossible to single out us, the two
of us, as we are, as the possible perpetrators of the
supposed crime.«
»Without any actual crime even taking place,« finished
Michael.
Flora fluttered her eyelids, took a long hard breath and
stroked a nearby cat.
»I have one simple stake in this and I’ve had it from the
start,« she gripped the cat’s neck and the animal let out
a languished cry of arousal, »where is the body?«
»We left it on the roof!«
»Well, that’s a rank thought, isn’t it?« said Flora, »what
happens when the sun’s rays boil the blisters and the
stench comes spoiling tenants’ dinners?«
»Then they find the body. I knew it!« Michael was back
on his road to nervous breakdown.
»We hadn’t thought of that,« stated Vera.
»How could you not?« asked Flora, »bodies, as arts,
rot.«
—

Bob barged into the place with the confidence of a
detective and the tactlessness of a very old man. That’s
how he felt for a moment. Old. Old and prying. Of
course she had company, she was still hip, still in the
charmer’s game of social interaction, that intermingling
welter of bodies where strangers become friends and
friends become spouses. He felt a kindred spirit in
Flora, a vulnerable creature fighting off chaos, just like
himself. And now here he was, a mere intruder upon
casual privacy. By god, this place was a wreck. Maybe
he dodged a bullet here.
»Hey Bob. What’s up?« asked Flora, while Michael and
Vera exchanged curious glances, mixed feelings of
annoyance and alarm.
»Um, nothing Flora,« he decided to pass himself off as
a harmless fool, but then said, fuck it, that’s what he
always does, »we found the body.«
Michael let out an intensely whispered »I knew it,« and
Vera covertly punched him in the ribs.
»On the roof?« asked Flora.
»On the … yes, on the roof! I thought of that!« Bob was,
for an instant, proud. »But how did you … How did you
know?«
Everybody’s bodies now felt tense and awkward. Flora’s
mind stayed bold.
»Elementary, Bob. Powers of deduction, cursory
knowledge of man’s inborn inclinations, a sprinkling of
the gut, and you have it – all laid out.«
»I mean, I had the coroner’s report to go on by, but you
…« Bob felt a tiny suspicion sprout in his mind.
Michael was mortified. »The coroners did me in.«
»What the hell are you talking about young man?«
»Bob,« Flora’s voice was calm and stern, »that is no
way to talk to my guests. You are in my home without
a proper invitation. Your behavior should remain
courteous.«
»I’m sorry Flora, miss Jenkins, I mean,« he just let it
all out, »I’m having an increasingly weird day, that’s
all. One moment I’m reading the reports, carefully
re-creating the bigger picture from bits and pieces of
random noise, and then the next moment I’m standing
on top of some roof, trying to make sense of a huge
rigor-mortised human penis that is firmly grasped in the
hand of a molten body without a head. There. How’s

that for courtesy?«
Flora smiled. Vera got her act on.
»Is this about that head?«
Bob dismissed her and continued. »And when I have
everything pin-pointed on a deviant sexual practice,«
(Michael coughed), »and am just about ready to hit all
the s&m joints in town, a clerk comes rushing to me like
he’s about to stop the goddamn nine-eleven. Detective,
detective, he yells, I found an admission of guilt. And
I say, what?, and he says he found it on the internet,
posted before anyone even knew of the head, including
you, miss Jenkins.«
»An admission of guilt?« asked Flora. Michael beamed
with pride. Somebody had actually read it. Vera was
happy for other reasons.
»Yes, a clearly stated admission of guilt. We have
beheaded Mr. D because he was a dirty banker, and so
on, and so on.«
»So,« Flora wondered, »isn’t that great? Not the actual
act of beheading, I mean, it’s great for you, now all you
have to do is find those who wrote that note.«
»Yeah, but here’s the thing,« said Bob, »I didn’t want
for this whole calvary to become so obviously political
in nature. The persons who did this, this beheading, did
it with political intent, to ‘galvanize public opinion’,
‘focus the rage on the bankers’, all fancy ideological
stuff like that … I have no stomach for politics. The
pressures, the foul play. I can’t get myself mixed up
in that. I don’t care why they did it, I just want them
in jail. But instead of a quiet, focused investigation,
I will be handed a full-fledged carnival of public and
private opinion to juggle as soon as the press, which is
inevitable, gets a hold of that dead erect cock!«
Michael failed to stifle his outburst of mirth. He laughed.
»Are you finding this funny, young man?«
»Bob, please,« Flora lowered the tension with her
outstretched arms. »This unfortunate conflation
of politics and sex is admittedly a nuisance, but you
shouldn’t lose your …« she grasped for a better word,
»… composure over it.«
»Guys, I’m sorry.« Bob’s shoulders slumped. »I’m
venting. I needed this. Thanks. I apologize.«
Everyone felt content for a minute.
»So, what’s up with that erection?« asked Vera, »I

88

mean, that’s weird, isn’t it?«
»Did he …« Michael hesitated, »was there any, you
know, semen, there?« He whispered semen.
»As a matter of fact yes,« said Bob, »plenty of it, all
dried up in little spots like … shit, you know what it
looks like.«
»So he experienced an orgasm just before dying?« Vera
faux-wondered aloud.
»Most likely, yes.«
»Well,« said Michael, »that’s pretty cool, isn’t it? I
mean, death is plenty bad in itself, no denying that, but
taking one last pleasure along to the great beyond must
count for something, right?«
The detective conceded this point with a shallow I-guess
and that somehow proved to be enough for Michael.
»I beheaded Donald,« he confessed, »but I did it to
prove a point.«
—
The debate was heated and intense. Michael was
handcuffed, Bob slightly empowered and the women
grief-stricken. Michael’s wrists hurt, and the women
wanted none of it. They implored freely, knowing full
well Bob couldn’t simply be called off, couldn’t raise
his hands, let bygones be bygones, water under the
bridge, sleeping dogs lain – no idiom had yet absolved a
perpetrator from his responsibilities.
»And we’re talking about a murder here!« Bob refused
to let Flora’s pleas turn the debate into some trivial
discussion. This was serious.
»But it was not a murder,« Michael’s voice was weakened
to the point of rasps and hisses.
»It was an allo-suicide!« Vera felt feverish, distraught.
»Not a murder, no, by any standards,« said Flora, »at
worst, a sensual euthanasia.«
»Oh for fuck’s sake people, are you all raving mad?«
cried Bob, »what am I supposed to tell my bosses? That
this was a simple quasi-politically motivated sex-noncrime, nearly a suicide, but not quite, it was mostly
putting someone out of his misery in erotic fashion, an
urgent wish paid in flesh?«
»Is art in this day and age still not exempt from the
tribulations of law?« despaired Vera. Bob felt an

immense desire to hurt her face.
»Most any art that does not leave a body in its wake!«
»Well, that is, figuratively speaking,« said Flora, »the
definition of bad art.«
Michael displayed a weary smile, »call it what you
will, detective, humanity will one day revere me as a
pioneer of time dilution. I, we, Vera and I, set about to
create the profane grail, a never-ending rapture mode,
dismantling of the fourth dimension at the precise
moment of bodily climax. Time is of no essence in the
realms of joy. There is only space, frozen space, bearing
the imprint of orgasm’s echoes … We have captured
pleasure, Bob,« he said, »and Donald is now trapped in
it. Find me a better way to die, find me a man who does
not lose his head in matters of pleasure, and I will plead
guilty –« his eyes glowed with zeal, »to man-slaughter,
to killing, to homicide, but foremost I will plead guilty
to the failure of my art.«
His cadence matched the tone of a funeral oration.
Vera’s eyes moistened.
»Bob, can there be no redress?« asked Flora, »is a hardly
desirable destiny fashioned by men of righteous intent
really meant for him?«
»We were right to do it,« said Vera.
Bob’s head shook with frustration.
»I can’t believe you managed to drag me down to this
level where we’re talking about a serious crime with
such poetic license. The way I see it, and I cannot be
brought to see it any other way, you committed a heinous
act of perversion, and anyone with a sane thought left
in his head will call it for what it is – downright murder.«
The word came out strong, bold and objective. Bob
embraced resolution, »I’ve had enough. I’m calling this
in. You can explain your projected suicides, eternal
orgasms and the discord between mind and matter to
the judge. Maybe you will find in him a kindred spirit.«
Vera snapped. »But, we were right to do it! He paid us
good money!«
»We’ll ask the jury how they feel about that.«
Her voice reached a boiling point. »Our peers hold
no jurisdiction over our artifice! Mere philistines of
judgment! We are artists!«
»Oh please,« said Bob, »what kind of an artist misspells
irreversible?«

The hatchet came out of nowhere and lodged itself
firmly into the detective’s throat. He made a grimace
of surprise, gushed blood and died. Only then did Vera
notice her bony grip on the hatchet’s handle. Only then
did she notice Flora’s inquisitive stare of ponderance
and wonder, Michael’s look of absolute disgust. »Uncuff
me.« That was all he said.
—
»Vera! What has become of you?« Michael’s hands were
freed and he waved them about, unleashing a punitive
tirade, »I’ve never seen anyone do a thing more trite!
Did you see the look on his face? This was in awfully bad
taste, Vera. Look! Look at what you’ve done, you can
still see it. Do you see it? His face? What is that on his
face?« he crouched and pointed at it, almost touching
Bob’s nose with his fingertip, »surprise! That’s surprise
there on his face! Not pleasure, not horror, not fear, not
excitement, nor calm, serenity or peace,« he stood up,
»no emotion of any meaning, nothing pure, set or final
there. Such banality, Vera!«
Vera could feel her lacrimal glands wring. Her philtrum
quivered. Michael was not finished.
»You thrust him into an eternity of the not-quitesure, just like that, into the vague, the hazy, and the
indistinct. Unbelievable, Vera, after all we’ve been
through … That you would stoop so low, to such depths
of cliché, and add another bland statement to further
the stereotype of man as une tête incomplète. I can live
without any of this.«
With that, Michael left.
Flora rarely understood the emotional vagaries of other
beings, but this one was pretty straight-forward. She
moved to form a cushioned embrace for Vera’s collapse,
squeezed the sobbing convulsions and let out a steady
series of there-theres intertwined with gentle pats on
Vera’s back. »Everything will be. Everything will be,«
she whispered. Her gaze was fixed on the detective’s
body, and her mind was ravaged by disparate concepts
of death … A stark conclusion was formed.
Her head was having the time of its life.

Well, I did not find it empty, no…

Ni se mi zdelo prazno, ne …

There was a pack of wild men, me and a bunch of others
like me, on a plain without a name. Pork hams, women,
pears. Somebody lit a fire by accident and, quickly, we
beat him up with sticks. They ate their meat raw, they
took their flesh raw, all was squealing, from fear? from
pleasure? … we think we know.

Bil je trop divjakov, jaz in še cel kup takih, na planjavi
brez imena. Šunke prašičje, babnice, hruške. Nekdo
je po nesreči zakuril ogenj in hitro smo ga potolkli s
palicami. Meso so uživali surovo, si ga jemali surovo,
vse je cvililo, od strahu? Ugodja? … mislimo, da vemo.

We think we know. We are talking about a group
of people, quite primitive by the nature of their
circumstances. Peace and plenty, that is. Simplicity of
life, instincts and sensations, nothing special, nothing
important.
Let us elaborate on the image. They spent their days
relaxing on the river bank, prostrating themselves
beneath the sun and each other. Women kept together in
a group, while the men preferred solitude. Equilibrium,
of course. We could, in any case, fill stacks of paper
writing about their stark essentials. In fact, I am quite
sure we have. Therefore, a few anecdotes will suffice.
Swine came out of the forest and passed through the
clearing on their way to the river. People observed
them in the faint glimmer of moonlight and their mouth
watered. The first pig finding himself on the wrong side
of the spear seemed quite astonished. The group, seeing

Mislimo, da vemo. Govora je o skupini ljudi, precej
primitivni po sili razmer. Mir in izobilje, namreč.
Preprostost življenja, nagoni in dražljaji, nič posebnega,
nič pomembnega.
Če razgrnemo podobo. Cele dneve so poležavali na
rečnem bregu, se nastavljali soncu in drug drugemu.
Ženske so se držale v skupini, moški pa bolj vsak zase.
Ravnotežje, seveda. Nasploh bi lahko o njihovih golih
osnovnostih danes popisali kupe papirja. Prepričan sem
celo, da smo. Torej bo zadostovalo le nekaj anekdot.
Ko so v svetlobi meseca opazovali svinje, ki so se iz
gozda čez čistino prihajale napajat k reki, so se jim
cedile sline. Prvi prašič, ki se je znašel na napačni strani
sulice, se je zdel precej začuden in čeprav je skupino
sprva zajel val zgražanja, ko so v podobi umirajočega
pujsa uzrli nekaj znanega, je okus še tople krvi hitro
zadušil zadržke. Od tedaj naprej so moški jagali
vsevprek.

something familiar in the scene of the dying animal, at
first felt a pang of indignation, but the taste of warm
blood quickly quenched their scruples. From then on
men hunted promiscuously.
Women plucked trees and shrubs for hazelnuts,
blackberries, pears. They did not eat apples. A memory
of an old man, choking himself on its seed, had
been passed on from generation to generation in the
language of a menacing finger. They threw the bodies
of their dead into the river, for the fish and the rapids
to consume.
When a woman's stomach began to grow, all men gazed
at her with suspicious eyes. On the day of delivery
women hid themselves among the high grasses, away
from curious glimpses, and from monstrous wailing they
soon unveiled a new human being. At the sight of it, of
its fragile body, the men rejoiced and forgot the magic,
but women did not forget their pain. Maybe that is why
they appreciated life more dearly.
With summer, storm clouds came. In the midst of the
torrent, wind, rain and flashes of lightning, the tribe
crowded together in a circle. Around the children,
squatting in the middle and pressing their palms to
their ears, women stood erect, half frightened and half
fierce, while the men hopped around them, answering
the thunder with wild howling and beating on their
chests, trying to hide their insignificance and humility in
the face of the hurricane. Because it always turned out
well, because the storm always passed, men held their
heads a bit more upright – until the next one.

I am stronger than the others. I take, because I can.
For this, nobody (judges, hates, respects, values, loves,

me. Until I spot him and write him down, he does not
exist. We need arrows …
I am. He is. He doesn't speak, nobody speaks. I write.
He is. ->

Ženske so obirale drevje in grmičevje, lešnike, robide,
hruške. Jabolk niso jedli, saj se je iz roda v rod z
govorico žugajočega prsta prenašal spomin na nekega
deda, ki se je zadušil s peško. Trupla so metali v reko,
ribam in brzicam.
Ko se je kakšni ženski pričel večati trebuh, so jo moški
merili s sumničavimi očmi. Na dan poroda so se vse
zavlekle med visoke trave, stran od zvedavih pogledov
in iz pošastnega kričanja privlekle na plano novega
človeka. Moški so se ob pogledu na njegovo krhko
telesce veselili in pozabili čarovnijo, ženske pa bolečine
niso. Morda so zato bolj cenile življenje. 
S poletjem so pridivjali nevihtni oblaki. Vsred hudourja,
vetra, dežja in pokanja strel, se je pleme nagnetlo v
krog. Okoli otrok, ki so čepeli v središču in si z rokami
zatiskali ušesa, so pokončno stale ženske, napol
preplašene in napol ponosne, okoli njih pa so skakali
moški, ki so gromu odgovarjali z divjim kričanjem in
razbijanjem po prsih, trudeč se skriti svojo majhnost
in ponižnost nasproti hurikana. Ker se je vedno dobro
izšlo, ker se je nevihta venomer unesla, so moški do
naslednje držali glave malo bolj pokonci.

Bolj močan sem kot vsi ostali. Vzamem, ker lahko.
Zaradi tega me nihče nič ne (obsoja, sovraži, spoštuje,
ceni, ljubi, zaničuje, …), ker nihče nič ne. Tudi jaz nič
ne. Dokler ga ne opazim in ga ne zapišem, njega sploh
ni. Potrebujemo puščice.
Jaz sem. On je. Ne govori, nihče ne govori. Jaz pišem.

When he was just a little boy, a young man used a pair of
rocks to create a spark and ignited a patch of dry weeds
on which an old woman was resting. Because she got a
nasty burn she started screaming. Men came rushing to
her aid, and they beat the young man with sticks and
sent him running away. He did not return. They growled
at the pile of charred weeds, spat and peed on it. It
hissed and sent gray fumes of smoke into the air, which
startled them. They moved higher up the river and did
not return to that place.
Because I do not understand time and that young man
left such a strong impression on my memory, I stare into
the woods each morning and wait for him to return.

osmojene trave, ga pljuvali in nanj urinirali. Zakadilo
se je, kar jih je silno vznemirilo. Premaknili so se višje
vzdolž reke in se niso vračali na tisti kraj.
Ker ne razumem časa in se mi je tisti mladenič tako
močno vtisnil v spomin, vsako jutro gledam proti gozdu,
kamor so ga pognali in čakam, da se vrne.

On ni bil črka in ni bil besedilo. Bil … Kako naj prodrem v
njegovo glavo? Kako v njegov čas? Takoj, ko ga zapišem,
se mi izmakne in postane nekdo drug. Nekdo – zdaj. In
ko ga prebereš? Mislim, da spet postane zdaj, tvoj zdaj.
Kakšna zagonetka.
Pravzaprav pa, kako sploh pisati o človeku, ki nima
jezika?
—

He was not a letter and not a text. Was … How can I
penetrate into his head? Or into his time? As soon as
I write him down, he takes a side-step and becomes
somebody else. Somebody – now. And when you read
him? I think he, again, becomes now, your now. What a
conundrum.
After all, how can you even write about a man that does
not use his tongue.

Polizal sem njen obraz, ker se mi je tako zahotelo in
ni se branila, torej … Jezik sem pomočil v mlako, da
bi jo okusil. Pokazal sem mu ga, ker me je motil. To
sem lahko storil, ker sem najmočnejši in se mi nihče
ne postavi po … robu. Če ne bi imel jezika, ne bi mogel
goltati prašičjega mesa in celo hrušk ne.
Vse bi ostalo zunaj, v praznini.

I licked her face, because I felt like it and she did not
defend herself, so … I dipped my tongue in a puddle to
taste it. I showed it to him, because he annoyed me.
I was able to do that, because I am the strongest and
nobody stands up … to me. If I didn't have a tongue, I
could not swallow pig's meat, nor even pears.
It would all stay outside, in the emptiness.

Spal je pod zvezdami in sanjale so ga. V kalup spomina
so vlivale njegove čute in občutja, v razvlečeno kašo
neke predzavesti. Se je nerazumno tihotapilo tam
zraven, je bil zmožen preskoka? Je pobarval svojo kožo
zeleno in poganjal zobe namesto las? Se je prostor krivil
v kaj neznanega? Je lahko sanjal o nečem, česar sploh
ni nikdar videl?  
Predramil se je in odgnal nadležno žuželko z gibom svoje
krepke roke. Nekdo je smrčal v temi. Strmel je v tisto
telo, ki je oddajalo tako nemogoč zvok. Po vseh štirih
se je pomaknil do njega in ga sunil v bok. Zdrznila se
je, se obrnila proti njemu in ko je v poltemi prepoznala
njegov obraz, se je zvila v klobčič, glavo pa mu položila
k trebuhu. Varna je bila v njegovem naročju.
Česa jo je bilo lahko strah? Divjih zveri, ki so se ogibale

Ko je bil še čisto majhen, je nek mladenič s parom skal

He slept under the stars and they dreamt of him.
Into the mould of memory they poured his senses and
feelings, creating a stretched pulp of some kind of preconsciousness. Did the irrational lurk there, was he
capable of a transcending leap? Did he paint his skin

green and grew teeth instead of hair? Did the space bend
into the unrecognizable? Could he dream of something
he had never seen?
He woke up and drove away an irritating insect with a
brush of his strong arm. Somebody was snoring in the
dark. He stared into the body that gave away such an
unbearable sound. Moving towards it on all fours, he
nudged it. She startled, turned to him and when she
recognized his face in the dusk, she curled up into a ball
and placed her head in his lap. She felt safe in his arms.
What could she be afraid of? Wild beasts, cowering
before the smell of man? Death? Did she even know that
it awaits her?
She fell asleep, and he didn't know what to do with
her. Lust was nowhere to be felt. What was he doing
there? Simply existing, like a rock, dying slowly with a
woman by his side? It seems almost impossible that he
would not think, that the synapses in his brains would
not pulsate with … something. But how? With colors,
images, geometry, with feelings? And, most importantly
– with what?
—
I was thinking of a strange thing that happened to me
that day. Some weak boy spent his day walking up and
down by the river, as if he were collecting steps, until
he finally approached a luscious woman. At first she
simply stared at him, without a response, but then,
when he stood his ground, she just snorted and pushed
him away, while all the women raised their voices into
an unusual clamour. This unrest did not signify danger,
no, it was something different … The boy moved away,
almost ran, and his face became completely red – when
I looked into his eyes, there was something so … So … I
don't know. I don't know what that was in his eyes. But
deep from within my belly a sound emerged. I never
heard it before. A pleasant sound, at least I thought so.
Everybody looked at me and for a moment it ceased,
only to come roaring back to the surface, as it emerged
from their bellies as well. All was full of it, full of this
… This laughter.

vonja človeka? Smrti? Je sploh vedela, da jo čaka?
Zaspala je, on pa ni vedel, kaj bi z njo. Sle ni bilo
od nikoder. Kaj je počel tam? Samo obstajal kot nek
kamen, počasi umiral sede z žensko ob sebi? Skoraj
nemogoče se zdi, da ne bi razmišljal, da mu sinapse
v njegovih možganih ne bi utripale z … nečim. Ampak
kako? Z barvami, podobami, geometrijo, s čustvi? In
predvsem – kaj?

Premišljeval sem o neki nenavadni stvari, ki sem jo
doživel tisti dan. Nek šibak fant je cel dan prestopal
gor in dol ob reki, kot bi zbiral korake, da se je končno
le nameril k najbohotnejši ženski našega plemena.
Najprej ga je samo gledala, brez odziva, potem, ko je
še kar naprej silil vanjo, pa je prhnila vanj in ga odrinila
z roko, vse ženske pa so povzdignile svoje glasove v nek
nenavaden trušč. Ni označeval nevarnosti, ne, ampak
nekaj drugega … Fant se je odmaknil, skoraj zbežal je
stran, njegov obraz pa je postal čisto rdeč in ko sem ga
pogledal v oči, je bilo v njih nekaj tako … Tako … Ne
vem. Ne vem, kaj je bilo tisto v njegovih očeh. Globoko
iz trebuha se mi je izvil nek zvok, ki ga nisem še nikoli
prej slišal, prijeten zvok, vsaj meni se je zdel. Vsi so
me pogledali in utihnil sem, trenutek zatem pa se je ta
zvok izvil še iz njihovih trebuhov in iz mojega je nato
kar planil, vse je bučalo od tega … Tega smeha.
—
Potem pa, potem … Potem pa ste vse izvlekli iz mene!
Iztrgali, ugrabili, izdolbli ste me, drobovje mojih čustev,
mojih nagonov, mojega človeškega bistva, lahko bi rekel
celo, da, mojo dušo, prodal sem jo, da, pa ne zastonj,
ne povsem zastonj, v zameno sem dobil lepoto in izgubil
celoto, razkrili ste praznino, ko ste me napravili v dva
človeka, ko ste mi nastavili ogledalo in mi odjeknili
odmev. S puščico prek niča ste me razklali, črke ste
ovesili na moje nagone, me z razumom vklenili v čas,
da moje bistvo sedaj plava, plava v toku neskončnega
dialoga intrepretacij.
Spoznanje ni več mogoče, resnica je tišina, resnica je
praznina. Mogoče je bilo le nekoč, takrat, v večnosti

And then, then … Then you pulled me inside out! Torn,
taken, you hollowed me out, the entrails of my feelings,
my instincts, my human essence, I could even say, yes,
my soul, I sold it, yes, but not for free, not for nothing, I
got beauty in return, but lost my entirety. You uncovered
the emptiness as you made me a double, facing me with
a mirror, sounding off my echoes into empty space.
You have split me apart with an arrow crossing over
nothing. You hanged letters on my urges, abused my
reason to chain me into time, so that my essence is
now floating, floating in a neverending current of
interpretations.
To know is no longer possible. Truth is silence, truth is
emptiness. It used to be possible before, then, in the
eternity of the moment.
—
He came back!
It is true. The young man that invented fire by
coincidence had returned in an image of an old man.
His face was covered with wrinkles, crowned with
graying baldness, and he painted his cheek-bones with
brown clay. A basket made of bark was slung over his
shoulders. In it sat a crippled old hag, barely alive, that
touched his ear with her lips and constantly hissed in it
with her split tongue.
They spotted him from afar, men grabbed their spears
and stood before the women and the children. I made
a step forward.
They stood eye to eye. He is dirty. He raised his palm
and tried to cleanse his cheeks, but the old man backed
away and smiled at him. I showed him my teeth too,
even though he felt no danger.
—
No danger? The violence that the old man is about to
permit himself will fling the doors of good and evil wide
open.
—

trenutka.

Vrnil se je!
Res je. Tisti mladenič, ki je po naključju našel ogenj, se
je vrnil v podobi starca. Njegov obraz je bil prepreden
z gubami, kronan s sivo plešo, ličnici pa si je prepleskal
z rjavo barvo ilovice. Na hrbtu je nosil koš spleten iz
lubja, v katerem je prenašal pokvečeno starko, komaj
še živo, ki se je z usti dotikala njegovega uhlja in
neprestano sikala vanj z razklanim jezikom.
Opazili so ga že od daleč, moški so pograbili sulice in se
postavili pred ženske in otroke. Stopil sem korak pred
njih.
Stala sta si iz oči v oči. Umazan je. Dvignil je roko in
mu skušal očistiti lice, starec se je umaknil in se mu
nasmehnil. Tudi sam sem mu pokazal zobe, čeprav ni
občutil nobene nevarnosti.
—
Nobene nevarnosti? Nasilje, ki si ga bo dovolil starec, je
na stežaj odprlo vrata dobremu in zlu.
—
S trohlo oljčno vejico, ki jo je držal stisnjeno v prstih,
je starec v pesek pred njegovimi nogami zarisal krog.
Nek moški je premagal strah, se iztrgal iz skupine in z
nogami planil na podobo, jo poteptal v prah, preden sem
ga zgrabil za ramo in ga odvlekel nazaj, prvič začuden.
Vejica je ponovila svoj gib in očarani smo strmeli v znak.
Starka na njegovem hrbtu je v veter spustila suh hehet.
Dvignil sem pogled, zazrl sem se vanj, on pa je iztegnil
v zrak svoj prst, ga usmeril vase in rekel: Am.
S prstom sem pokazal nase in rekel: Am. Zmajal je
z glavo, starka je zažugala s prstom, nato pa konico
usmerila vame in siknila: Si.
S prstom je pokazal nase in rekel: Si. Prikimala sta mu.
Člani plemena so postajali nemirni, prestopali so se na
nogah, iz grl jim je uhajalo pritajeno renčanje.
Obrnil sem se in jo pogledal, njo, ki je smrčala tisto
noč. Noht sem ji prislonil ob čelo in rekel: Vo. Starec je

With a brittle olive branch, which was held tight in his
fingers, the old man drew a circle in the sand beneath
his feet.
A man overcame his fear, pulled away from the group
and plunged feet-first right onto the figure, trampled it
to dust, before I grabbed his shoulder and dragged him
back, amazed for the first time.
The branch repeated its movements and we gazed at
the sign with wonder.
The hag on his back tossed a dry chuckle to the wind. I
lifted my sight, stared at him, while he raised his finger
in the air, pointed it to himself and said, Am.
I pointed my finger to myself and said, Am. He shook his
head, the hag shook her finger, then pointed the tip at
me and hissed, Si.
He pointed his finger at himself and said, Si. They
nodded their heads. Members of the tribe grew restless,
they shuffled their feet, stilled growling was rising from
their throats.
I turned and looked at her, the one that was snoring that
night. Pressing my fingernail to her forehead, I said, Vo.
The old man started beating his palms together, he was
clapping.
He offered him his branch, I took it, I followed the circle
with its sharp end, I pressed harder, it went deeper.

Divided. Taken away from the deluge of sense, poorly
driven over instinct's shallow river-beds. What was
before an uninterrupted string of images, impressions,
sensations, transfusions of color, darkness and light,
pain, pleasure, sound and silence, has suddenly
sharpened itself into consciousness.
A terrible void has driven the consciousness and the
world apart. It used to be so simple to fill it up – we just
had to satisfy our urges.
It cannot be filled no more. But our instincts, our urges
are still howling with hunger, howling like starved
wolves, so that we throw into it, we throw and we
throw and we throw in vain, into this bottomless pit,
I, you, mine, yours, theirs, ours, it was, it will be, all
these blind questions, all those mute answers – and
other such things that we all find quite clear.

z dlanjo pričel tolči ob dlan, ploskal mu je.
Ponudil mu je vejico, vzel sem jo, z njenim koncem sem
sledil že zarisanemu krogu, bolj trdo sem pritisnil, šlo
je globlje.
—
Ločen. Odvzet povodnji čuta, za silo speljani čez plitve
struge nagona. Kar je bilo prej nepretrgan niz podob,
vtisov, občutij, prelivanja barv, teme in svetlobe,
bolečine, ugodja, zvoka in tišine, se je nenadoma
zaostrilo v zavest.
Med zavestjo in svetom je zazevala strašna praznina, ki
jo je bilo nekoč tako preprosto zapolniti z zadostitvijo
nagonu.
A čeprav praznine ni več moč zapolniti, nagon še vedno
tuli od lakote, zavija kot sestradan volk, da vanjo jalovo
mečemo, mečemo, mečemo, v to luknjo brez dna, jaz,
ti, moje, tvoje, njihovo, naše, bilo je, bo, vsa ta slepa
vprašanja, vse te neme odgovore – in še druge take
stvari, ki so nam vsem jasne.
 
—
Starec je odšel, a dal mi je vedeti, da se kmalu vrne.
Obstajati je postalo na trenutke skorajda neznosno.
Ovedli so se vsi člani plemena. Skoraj vsi – tisti moški,
ki je s stopali skočil na krog, je ostal žival. Kot bi bil v
pasti, je renčal na tujce, ki so kar naenkrat ždeli okrog
njega, in ker jim ni več znal zaupati, ga je premagal
strah, da je z divjim kričanjem pobegnil v gozd. Niso
šli za njim.
Vo je moja ženska. Če se ji kdo približa, če jo kdo samo
pregloboko pogleda, mu zagrozim s pestjo. Svinje lovim
tudi kadar nisem lačen. Meso kopičimo na krvave kupe,
ki privabljajo muhe in čez čas pošastno smrdijo, zato
jih hitro zakopljemo. Ženske nosijo na druge kupe
hruške, ki zdržijo dalj časa. Ko kdo preneha sodelovati
z nami, to je, če umre, ga z laneno vrvjo obesimo na
drevo globoko v gozdu.
Tako jim je svetoval starec.
Nisem ga razumel. Nečesa me je moral naučiti, preden
je odšel, jaz pa se nisem mogel približati njegovemu
ponujenemu odgovoru, dokler se nisem sam dokopal do

The old man left, but made it known he will return
soon. At times, to exist became almost unbearable.
All members of the tribe gained consciousness. Almost
all – that man who trampled the circle in the sand
remained an animal. Feeling trapped, he growled at
the strangers that had now surrounded him. He could
not trust them any longer, fear overcame him, so he ran
shrieking into the forest. They did not follow.
Vo is my woman. If anyone comes near her, if anyone
just looks at her for too long, I threaten him with my
fist. I hunt pigs even when I am not hungry. Meat is then
gathered in bloody heaps that attract flies and develop
a foul odour over time, prompting us to bury them.
Women make piles of pears. They last longer. When
somebody ceases to co-operate, if he dies, we hang him
on a tree in the forest with a flax rope.
The old man told them so.
I did not understand him. He had to teach me something
before he left, but I could not grasp his offered answer
until I brought myself to the question. He followed me
around, drew that circle in the ground and pointed at it,
and pointed at himself and waved his branch around his
head, the hag on his back steaming with some unknown
anger, while I just kept shrugging my shoulders, doing
hollow things.
The old man calmed the tribe with his palms, sat them
down and built a pile of dry wood in their midst. Striking
flint against flint, he stared at them calmly. When the
fire was started, the tribe grew frightened. He let air
course through his lips, shhhhhh, and they calmed
down. He spitted a piece of meat on a stick and held it
over the fire. Then he offered it around to be tasted. It
was delicious.
My eyes were fixed on the flames, flickering in
wondrous colours, keeping me warm in the chill of the
night, dissolving wood to gray ash. I could not explain
it to myself, it seemed too hard to believe, as if it did
not have a place in my existence, in my life. When I
saw him watching me, I stood up, approached him and
asked, somehow, with my whole body. What is all this?
He lifted himself up, grabbed his olive branch and drew

vprašanja. Sledil mi je, risal tisti krog v tla in kazal
nanj in kazal nase in mahal okoli sebe s tisto njegovo
palico, in ženska na njegovem hrbtu je cvilila od neke
jeze, jaz pa sem skomigal z rameni in počel stvari v
prazno.
Starec je pleme pomiril z rokami, jih posedel po tleh
in sredi njih na kup nanosil dračje. Zrl je vanje s
pomirjujočim pogledom, ko je s kremenom kresal ob
kremen in ko je zanetil ogenj, se je pleme prestrašilo,
on pa je skozi ustnice spuščal zrak, ššššššššš, da so
obsedeli pri miru. Kos mesa je nabodel na palico, ga
podržal nad ognjem, nato pa jim ga ponudil v ugriz. Bilo
je odlično.
Oči sem imel uprte v plamene, poskakovali so v čudovitih
barvah, me greli v hladnem večeru, razkrajali les v siv
pepel. Nisem si znal razložiti, preveč neverjetno se mi je
zdelo, kot bi ne imelo mesta v mojem obstoju, v mojem
življenju. Ko sem videl, da me opazuje, sem vstal, šel
do njega in s celim telesom nekako vprašal: Kaj je vse
to?
Vstal je, prijel oljčno vejico in v tla zarisal krog. Nisem
našel potrpljenja, zahteval sem odgovor in ne spet
iste norosti. Ženska za njegovim hrbtom je pokazala
zobe, on me je nežno stisnil za ramo. Pokazal je krog.
Prikimal sem. Pokazal je nase in mi predstavil sebe,
kako gleda ta krog. Spet sem prikimal. Nato je s palico
obkrožil najino obzorje in pokazal na krog. Napol sem
razumel. Nato je pokazal zahajajoče sonce, poloblo, ki
je še štrlela izza oddaljenih hribov; pokazal svoje oči
pa spet sonce in s palico obkrožil obzorje; pokazal na
krog in spet sonce in sebe, ki gleda na krog in sonce, ki
gleda na obzorje.
Razumel je. Zjutraj starca in starke ni bilo več nikjer.

Bilo je neznosno, ker nisem bil več sam. Praznina je
bila zapolnjena s soncem, ki me je opazovalo, vsak
moj gib, vsako mojo misel in lahko sem si predstavljal
sonce, kako negoduje nad tem, kar storim in nad tem,
kar mislim, kot sem jaz negodoval nad člani našega
plemena, nad divjo svinjo, ki kruli v noč, nad nevihto.
Mir sem imel le ponoči, pa še to bolj napol, takrat
sem srepel v luno in zvezde, ki me niso pustile spati.

Samega sebe in vse nas sem gledal z očmi, ki niso bile
več moje …

a circle in the ground. I did not find the patience, I
demanded an answer, not the same folly yet again.
The woman behind his back showed her teeth, he
gently squeezed my shoulder. He pointed at the circle.
I nodded. He pointed at himself, and presented him
observing the circle. I nodded. Then he circled our
horizon with the branch and pointed at the circle. I
half-understood. Then he pointed at the setting sun,
its hemisphere still peeking over the distant hillside,
pointed at his eyes, at the sun again, circled his branch
around the horizon, pointed at the circle, the sun, at
himself, observing the circle, and the sun, observing
the horizon.
He understood. Next morning, the old man and the hag
were gone.

Vrnila sta se, a ne sama. Neznanski trušč je prebudil
pleme, divja koračnica horde ljudstev, ki so hodili
za njima me je vrgla na noge, me prestrašila iz sna.
Ljudje, tujci, vseh barv in oblik, so za seboj po planjavi
vlekli ogromno skalo. Oblak prahu in silno bobnenje je
v srca plemena takoj vžgalo spoštovanje. Starec se mu
je približal.
Spet je zarisal v tla znak in pokazal na skalo. Hotel je
povedati, da bodo napravili velikanski krog. Skomignil
sem z rameni, zakaj? Pokazal je proti nebu. Za sonce!

It was unbearable, because I was no longer alone. The
emptiness was filled with the sun that set watch over
me, over my every move, my every thought. I could
imagine it finding faults with my actions, my thoughts,
just like I was displeased with some members of our
tribe, with the wild boar grunting in the night, with
the storm. I only found peace at night, and even that
half-heartedly. The moon and the stars did not let me
sleep. I saw myself, and all of us, with eyes that were
no longer mine …

Za sonce! Bojni krik tedanjega človeštva, ki je uprlo
moči danih jim teles v nekaj, kar jih je presegalo, ravno
zato, ker jih je presegalo.
Tolikšna množica še čisto primitivnih ljudi na kupu je
sprožila razvoj družbenih struktur, po nekakšni naravni
logiki so udomačili svinje, jih z navdušenjem redili,
pa ustvarili polja, na katerih so obdelovali pšenico,
za potrebe gradnje so sekali gozdove, se zavoljo
preglednosti družili v družine, družine družili v klane,
učili otroke, lovili ribe, pekli kruh in kaj vem kaj še vse
– nasploh je povsod gomazelo od človeške dejavnosti.
Danes vemo, da so spomenik soncu čez čas načrtno
zasuli. Morda se jim je stožilo po preprostem. Morda so
se nadejali odgovorov, ker pa je sonce ostalo nemo, so
menda mislili, da jih je izdalo. Morda …

They returned, but not by themselves. A horrendous
commotion woke up the tribe. Marching wildly, the
horde of peoples following them, threw me on my
feet, scared me from my sleep. People, strangers, of
all sights and sounds, were dragging a huge rock across
the plain. Hearts of the tribe were immediately marked
with respect for the thundering and clouds of dust. The
old man came to him.
Again he drew a sign in the sand, then he pointed at the
rock. He wanted to tell me that they will make a giant
circle. I shrugged my shoulders, why? He pointed at the
sky. For the sun!

Ko je bil gromozanski krog zaključen, si je starec zaželel
njegove družbe. Govorila sta s kretnjami.
Rekel sem – pa sedaj?
Skomignil je z rameni – ne vem.
Namrščil sem obrvi – kako ne veš?
Ponovil je – ne vem.
Postal sem jezen – to smo storili za sonce, sedaj nas
bo zagotovo gledalo bolj naklonjeno, nam bolj toplo

For the sun! The battle cry of humanity that fixed
the power of their given bodies into something that
exceeded them, precisely because it exceeded them.
Such a multitude of primitive people in one spot
triggered the development of social structure. By some
natural logic they domesticated swine, breeding them
with enthusiasm, they plowed fields and sown wheat,
while the necessity of construction made them cut down
forests. For ease of distinction they banded themselves
into families, united families into clans, taught their
children, caught fish, baked bread and who knows what
else – all was teeming with human activity.
Today we know that in time they buried this monument
to the sun on purpose. Maybe they longed for simplicity.
Maybe they expected answers and when the sun
remained silent they may have felt that it betrayed
them. Perhaps …
—
When the giant circle was finished, the old man desired
his company. They spoke with gestures.
I said – now what?
He shrugged his shoulders – I don't know.
I frowned – what do you mean, you don't know.
He repeated – I don't know.
I grew angry – we did this for the sun, now it will
surely look at us with benevolence, light our way with
warmth, protect us, guide us through the darkness …
He shook his head – no, the sun won't do anything, for
we are not its concern.
I roused myself – what? so you lied to us and it was all
for naught? so we dragged all this rock out here for no
reason at all?
He sighed – not for no reason. look. before it, there
was nothing here, it was empty, at least to us,
humans. as I gazed into this emptiness, I wondered
at the indifference of this space. Not just wondered
– it taunted me, it even threatened me. I decided to
burn myself into it, to somehow prove to it that I am.
that we are. that is why! that is why we will fill it up
with names, we will build ourselves over it and we will

svetilo, nas varovalo, nas vodilo čez temo …
Odkimal je z glavo – ne, sonce ne bo nič, ker se ga mi
ne tičemo.
Vzrojil sem – kaj? Torej si nam lagal in je bilo vse zaman,
torej smo brez razloga na kup zvlekli vso to kamenje?
Zavzdihnil je – ne brez razloga. Poglej. Prej ni bilo na
tem mestu ničesar, prazno je bilo, vsaj nam, ljudem. Ko
sem zrl v to praznino, me je čudila brezbrižnost tega
prostora; ne le čudila, izzivala me je, mi celo grozila.
Sklenil sem se vžgati vanjo, ji nekako le dokazati, da
sem. Da smo. Zato! Zato jo bomo napolnili z imeni,
gradili se bomo čeznjo in se na vse pretege borili za
njeno priznanje. Za priznanje, da smo.
Bolelo me je – sonce nas ne gleda?
Pokazal mi je zobe in še enkrat skomignil z rameni.
Vdal sem se, moral sem se vdati – torej nam ne
preostane drugega … kot da gradimo naprej.
Prikimal je. Starka na njegovem hrbtu je ugriznila v
rdeče jabolko, s prstom druge roke pa pokazala na
veličasten krog.
»Kaj ni lepo?« je dejala s polnimi usti.
Z nasprotne strani gradbišča so se ob pogledu na prvo
človekoskrunstvo iz grl ljudi izvili živalski kriki. Nek
kmet je namreč z gorjačo do smrti potolkel redilca
svinj, ker ta za navaden hlebec kruha ni hotel menjati
kosa svoje mastne mastne šunke.

fight with all our strength for its recognition. for the
recognition, that we are.
I was in pain – the sun does not watch us?
He showed me his teeth and yet again shrugged his
shoulders.
I gave up, I had to give up – so there is nothing else for
us to do … but to keep on.
He nodded. The hag on his back took a bite from a red
apple and with the finger of her other hand pointed at
the magnificent circle.
»Isn't it beautiful?« she said with her mouth full.
From the other side of the construction-yard animal
cries rose up from the throats of men at the sight of the
first human desecration. A swine-breeder was clubbed
to death by a farmer because he would not trade a
piece of his greasy, greasy ham for an ordinary loaf of
bread.

This is the IDIOT. The best of. Devoted to poetry, prose, theory and drama since April 2009. Published by the Paraliterary Organization
I.D.I.O.T, currently stationed in Slovenia and founded by Tibor Hrs Pandur, Uroš Prah, Katja Perat and Jasmin B. Frelih. Formed with the wish
to open a space which will track the development of modern literary practice and bring together students, published and unpublished
authors of the 21st century. A naïve wish perhaps, to create a new generation and to simply start a new Renaissance, without further
explanation.
The IDIOT wants to mingle. The IDIOT doesn’t dig the mafia. Doesn’t understand clans: Yours – Ours. The IDIOT proclaims a war to borders.
In heads. In states. Why shouldn’t we duplicate information? Isn’t information a ray of light or another frequency? Isn’t art only a few lines
spread across paper? Doesn’t a ray belong to everyone who can remember it? The IDIOT doesn’t belong. Or it belongs to ALL. The IDIOT
wants to jam, grow everywhere. The IDIOT writes itself against time, against the bazooka, always against the current. Always towards
somewhere. This is the modern age. Tactics are ample to change. (Note to self: Electricity isn’t hermetic. Beauty is simple. You don’t have
to wrap it into obscure quazi-intellectual symbols. Look at the beauty of an ant, that crawls onto your paper by chance so that you have
to flick it away to continue.) THE IDIOT OPENED A SPACE and now it’s OPEN. The IDIOT is happy when he sees others thrive and work
and grow. The IDIOT wants voices in interaction. To mingle infinitely. To enter everywhere. The IDIOT wants the shine of all potentials. In
development. Surging. Of an undeniable frequency which grows, vibrates and moves. And he feels that this is somehow, almost, I hope,
maybe the sense of it all.
To je IDIOT. Najboljše do slej. Namenjen poeziji, prozi, teoriji in drami od Aprila, 2009. Tiska ga Paraliterarna organizacija I.D.I.O.T, ki so jo
ustanovili Tibor Hrs Pandur, Uroš Prah, Katja Perat in Jasmin B. Frelih. Formiran iz želje odpreti prostor, ki bo spremljal in objavljal razvoj
moderne literarne prakse ter povezati študente, uveljavljene tako kot neuveljavljene avtorje 21. stoletja. Skratka, iz morda naivne želje
ustvariti novo generacijo in preprosto sprožiti Renesanso, ne da bi preveč razlagali.
IDIOT hoče minglat. IDIOT ne šteka mafije. Ne razume klanov: Vaši – Naši. IDIOT ne razume. IDIOT napove vojno mejam. V glavah. V državah.
Zakaj ne bi podvojevali, potrojevali informacij? Ni informacija žarek svetlobe ali katerekoli druge frekvence? Ni umetnost samo par črt
razporejenih na papirju? Ne pripada žarek vsem, ki si ga lahko zapomnijo? IDIOT ne pripada. Ali pa pripada VSEM. IDIOT hoče đemat, se
plodit povsod. IDIOT se piše proti času, proti bazuki, vedno proti toku. Vedno proti nekam. To je moderna doba. Taktika se skoz spreminja.
(Note to self: Elektrika ni hermetična. Lepota je preprosta. Ne rabiš je zavijat v obskurne kvaziintelektualne simbole. Glej lepoto mravlje, ki
ti pride na list slučajno in jo moraš frcnit proč, če hočeš nadaljevat.) IDIOT JE ODPRL PROSTOR in zdaj je ODPRT. IDIOT je srečen, ko vidi
druge uspevat in delat in rast. IDIOT hoče glasove v interakciji. Minglat neskončno. Vstopit povsod. IDIOT hoče žarenje vseh potencialov. V
razvoju. V klitju. Neizpodbitne frekvence. Ki raste, pulzira in se razvija. In čuti da je to nekako, verjetno, upam, skoraj, mogoče smisel vsega.
